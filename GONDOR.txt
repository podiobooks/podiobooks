Here's some notes on how to work with Gondor.

Gondor is a command-line deployment tool, which makes scripting activities with it easy.

Setting up your Gondor Command line:

1) Get a Gondor account via https://gondor.io/account/signup/
2) Have a Podiobooks admin add you to the Gondor Podiobooks Group
3) Set up a .gondor file in your home directory with your Gondor key : https://gondor.io/support/quick-how-to/

Installing the Gondor Client:

1) Run the podiobooks/devscripts/virtualenv/setup_dev_env.sh script, and it will create a virtualenv with gondor in it.
2) In terminal from the podiobooks top dir: . .env/bin/activate to switch to the new virtualenv
2) You should now be able to run gondor commands from your command line : https://gondor.io/support/client/
