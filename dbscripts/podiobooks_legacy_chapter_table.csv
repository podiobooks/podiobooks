That there would be a glorious victory over evil. Now it seems that it would be anything, but what Enoch expected. 

Conference room 216 was quiet except for the sounds of a television when Hector entered it mid-morning. He had surprisingly taken his brother's advice, and put everything in the back of his mind so he could get some rest. However, all the stress that Hector was able to shrug off was driven straight back in its origin when he saw the faces of the occupants of the conference room. Everyone was sullenly staring at the television in the corner of the room, which was locked on the local news channel.","http://media.podiobooks.com/attheappointedtime/PB-At_The_Appointed_Time-13.mp3","2006-02-08 07:30:10","2009-11-02 06:52:36","1","1","0","Episode 13: You Do Not Need, You Desire AND Absolute and Unstoppable","6735395",,"2372"

Freddy brings back Ray's creative writing ability with a few stories, and then -- it's payback time.","http://media.podiobooks.com/aliensandsataniccreatureswantedhumansneedno/PB-AliensWanted-36.mp3","2006-05-08 04:49:32","2009-10-31 05:23:16","1","1","0","Freddy","10687851","audio/mpeg","3209"

But what if there was an outside influence being applied causing certain events to occur that might not have had the influence not been applied. Isn't that tampering with our lives and our world? Are we maturing as a race of humans or are we following some alien pattern that is being forced upon us? That's the way two humans feel when they are asked to join an alien organization that does just that.","http://media.podiobooks.com/aliensandsataniccreatureswantedhumansneedno/PB-AliensWanted-18.mp3","2006-01-25 13:08:04","2009-10-31 05:20:53","1","1","0","18.

"2701","35","14","It's after the San Quentin Riot, and Bradley has now received stitches. He's is leaving the operating room, and when the prison guard stops him at a desk bordering the mess hall Bradley peers through the window and down a floor, at the dinning crowd. He then notices a priest. The priest is a black man who is vigorously communicating with another black prisoner. What Brad initially thinks is arguing starts to appear as pleading. The priest had been animated with his hands pointing to different areas of the prison and at times its members. He wears a distressed look upon his face, and each response is more agitated. Also surprising to Brad is the fact that a humongous Aryan looking prisoner has his arms folded sporting several association based tattoos of his own, and is nodding along with whatever the priest was arguing. Listen to Chapter 16 - ""Only Thru The Lamb"" to find out.","http://media.podiobooks.com/attheappointedtime/PB-At_The_Appointed_Time-14.mp3","2006-02-08 07:31:21","2009-11-02 06:53:28","1","1","0","Episode 14: Only Through the Lamb","11678450",,"1552"

He needed to find Bradley, but there were many water edges to check and San Pablo Bay was very large. He turned down the frontage road that split the freeway and the edge of the bay, and noticed several people staring and pointing toward the smoky walls of the prison. The waterfront home owners, who were adjacent to the prison, were all out peering across the water looking at the aftermath of what had just happened. He softly said out loud, 'Oh LORD, help me to find the lad. I need you now.' Then he noticed several of the home owners grouped together at the end of the dock which ran along behind the housing row. They were lifting someone out of the water. He sped as fast as he could towards the foot of the dock, and brought his truck to a dusty stop. He jumped out and ran over to the emerging man, and thanked the LORD as he saw a shaved head.","http://media.podiobooks.com/attheappointedtime/PB-At_The_Appointed_Time-15.mp3","2006-02-08 07:33:02","2009-11-02 06:53:50","1","1","0","Episode 15: Everything is Different Now","11756291",,"2307"
"2703","35","16","Bradley and Augustine rode the elevator together up to the 19th floor of the Mark in silence. Brad's mind was racing, as it had been all day long. He needed rest, but knew if he tried he wouldn't be able to fall asleep anyway. The door opened and Bradley spotted Father Mac from the back, sitting watching television in the center of the room. Father Mac turned to see, and slowly rose to his old feet when he saw Bradley; a bit in awe. By this time Bradley figured any man of the cloth was on the good side, and he followed Augustine out of the elevator and into the sun filled room with his still wet clothes, and matching handcuff braclets. ""This is Father Mac,"" Augustine introduced. Mac extended his hand, and Bradley shook it with a jingle of the handcuffs. ""He and I areâ€¦ well, we'reâ€¦"" Augustine turned to Mac with a look of contemplation on his face. Mac picked up, ""Bradley, I'm sure that you have questions. Now time is something we don't have too much of, but you deserve answers, so we shall give what we can.""

In the sword shop they are tested by their combat teacher, Ms. Vanmie, for defensive style. She swings a bamboo pole at them several times to see how they react.

During Wilkes' second season in Richmond, John Brown raids Harper's Ferry, hoping to set off a slave insurrection, and panicking the South. Brown is quickly captured, but Southerners who want secession use Brown as an excuse. 

 

Wilkes meets Ned in Boston, which is hysterical over Brown, and performs Richard the Third with him. Wilkes finds the town too staid. At a gathering after the theater, Adam Badeau (Ned's New York teacher and confidante) tells Ned he has heard that Mary is in Boston, acting in Charlotte Cushmans company, and is going to marry a Boston lawyer. Ned is devastated. 

 

Back in Richmond, Wilkes joins the Richmond Grays and travels to Charlestown to watch the hanging of John Brown, then returns to begin his role as a national star.

 The four friends are pre-chosen, an event that baffles all of the school staff and The Council of Elders. As a result, they get assigned to their tribes, meet some upperclassmen and learn a little about the Magi sport of flags.

In a match, Shaya, after a particularly bruising bump, attacks the player who bumped her, who then beats her senseless. Humiliated, Shaya returns to Israel, to the house of her father, who lives in a town called Tsfat. On the downside of her condition, she emails Artie that she is going to blow up the Dome of the Rock, a holy Muslim shrine. But when her father shows her a polo field he has built for her in Tsfat, she decides instead to challenge the Palestinians to a polo match - and the Palestinians accept.","http://media.podiobooks.com/thetenthcow/PB-TheTenthCow-02.mp3","2006-03-25 12:58:35","2009-10-21 04:09:25","1","1","0","Episode 2","22215537",,"1485"

Shaya's father takes Artie to the Ari Sephardic synagogue, where Artie makes a wish.","http://media.podiobooks.com/thetenthcow/PB-TheTenthCow-03.mp3","2006-03-25 12:58:55","2009-10-21 04:13:51","1","1","0","Episode 3","15891398",,"1307"

When Zvi runs out of answers, he takes Teddy and Artie to Asher, the oenologist who runs the kibbutz. Asher refuses to answer any questions, so Teddy and Artie take a tour of the kibbutz winery and learn about the making of kosher wine.","http://media.podiobooks.com/thetenthcow/PB-TheTenthCow-05.mp3","2006-03-25 12:59:39","2009-10-21 04:19:05","1","1","0","Episode 5","14854766",,"1254"

Teddy ignores the question, as he always has when Artie asks him about his work. Teddy has also found out that Asher is Swiss and had arrived in Israel six years before. Later, practicing at the Golan kibbutz, Artie realizes that the heifer is gone. In the woods, he spots Teddy and a man he calls ""The Suit."" Teddy tells Artie the heifer has been moved to the kibbutz near Har Megiddo -- and that a stream of rabbis are coming out from Jerusalem to see it. That night, he invites Artie to dinner in his hotel room. With the dinner comes a bottle of pinot from the Golan winery. Artie demands Teddy tell him why he is involved with the red heifer.

Artie and Shaya are nervous about the accommodations; Shaya isn't ready to share a bed with anyone. In the hotel dining room, they meet the Goyish Friends of Israel, and Artie learns to his surprise - though he doesn't understand why - that there are Christians who are as eager to see the Second Jewish Temple rebuilt as any Jew. Artie knows the red heifer has to do with the Second Temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D. No Jew can step on the grounds where the Second Temple stood unless he follows an ancient ritual: he must be purified by the ashes of a pure red heifer, and there have been only nine of them in history until now. When they go back to their room, Shaya relents, and they make love.

Jerry Steinberg -- an American ex-hippie, now messianic Jew -- tells them what the Institute is up to. The Institute believes that after the Six Day War Israel entered the period of the End of Days, and they are awaiting the coming of the Messiah. But the Messiah won't come until the Second Temple is rebuilt -- and that's what the Institute wants to do.","http://media.podiobooks.com/thetenthcow/PB-TheTenthCow-08.mp3","2006-03-25 13:02:13","2009-10-21 04:27:08","1","1","0","Episode 8","16036162",,"1247"
"3550","65","9","DANIEL BAR-ILAN - Teddy takes Artie and Shaya to meet Daniel Bar-Ilan, professor of comparative religion at the Hebrew University. Bar-Ilan tells them that the Bar Kochba Institute has gone farther than Steinberg had said: they have put out a law book based on the law in effect at the time of the Second Temple; they have reconstructed the courthouse of the Sanhedrin, the priestly court of those times, and they want the Sanhedrin to be reconstituted, and Israel to be governed by a court of rabbis, under a king. Not only that, they are using DNA testing to identify descendants of Moses' brother Aaron - the only people qualified to be Temple priests. They are teaching young boys who qualify the priestly rituals. Bar-Ilan lays out the bottom line: the Institute intends to sacrifice the red heifer and purify its members, then go onto the Temple Mount and rebuild the Second Temple. But to do that, they will have to destroy the Dome of the Rock, since it sits on the exact spot the Second Temple occupied. And that could provoke a worldwide nuclear Holy War.","http://media.podiobooks.com/thetenthcow/PB-TheTenthCow-09.mp3","2006-03-25 13:02:37","2009-10-21 04:30:18","1","1","0","Episode 9","15466263",,"1197"

The old man who owns the liquor store tries to dissuade him, saying that the wine may not be any good, since pinot grapes do not grow well in Israel. Artie says he's tasted it and that it's excellent. The old man shrugs and gives him what he wants. At the end of the first day of shivah, a chasid appears at the front door. He is elegantly dressed, sharp-nosed and speaks with a Boston accent. He asks for Shaya's father. Artie tells him the old man is asleep. The chasid turns and disappears, as people do in Tsfat.

He gets a call from his son David in New York, from whom he is estranged. David tells him there might be a war with Syria, and David wants him to come home. Artie gets a newspaper, and reads that the American president has announced that the WMD's supposed to be in Iraq had been trucked into Syria just before the invasion. He demands that Syria open to U.S. inspection. If they don't, the U.S. will invade. Later, Bar-Ilan drops by and warns Artie that Syria has threatened that any U.S. inspectors will be arrested and confined; and if the U.S. attacks Syria, Syria will attack Israel.

Wilkes returns to smuggling contraband. Edwin returns to the stage, afraid he will not be well received - but he is a sensation. He is so relieved that he finds himself for the first time able to talk to strangers. He attends New York's premier salons and soirees, and starts drinking again. 

 

When Wilkes arrives in New York, he finds Edwin a drunkard. Wilkes brings word from Boston that Mollie is ill.

AUTHOR'S NOTES: Meet Garum and Vayin, the original ""Children of Rhatlan.""  I came up with the idea for duals in 1994 when I began to really focus on being a professional writer, under the instruction of Lee Killough.  The first story was simply called ""Duals,"" and it featured Garum and Vayin many years later.  After writing ""Children of Rhatlan,"" however, I will likely ascribe the two early stories about them to an alternate future.  The truth is, I don't know where the young duals' adventures will take them and I want to leave their future open.","http://media.podiobooks.com/childrenofrhatlan/PB-ChildrenOfRhatlan-01.mp3","2006-10-04 00:28:16","2009-11-04 23:21:51","1","1","0","Chapter 1: Impulse To Steal","7635552","audio/mpeg","2759"

"49357","105","40","History indicates that the Exhorter has a sense of motion that propels him to act so as to maintain continuity of function.

"49358","105","41","History affirms that Exhorter strategy is responsible for the initial stages of self-initiated action.

"49359","105","42","We see in history that Exhorter strategy, consistent with being an initial stage in the formulation of self-initiated action, prods others, and itself acts often by talking.

This combines with a poor sense for money and for ownership, and with actual physical clumsiness once more indicating that Exhorter strategy is an initial mental mode. We see finally that optimization, when it does occur, is carried out in real time, in contrast to Contributor long-term imaginative planning.","http://media.podiobooks.com/allsortsofpeopleorderedcomplexity/PB-AllSortsOfPeople-43.mp3","2006-11-13 09:20:08","2009-10-31 06:00:55","1","1","0","Book 2: The Magical Mystery Tours of Mr. Excitement Part 20","31504830","audio/mpeg","236"

"49372","105","46","History shows that optimization of outside entities, as part an initial mental strategy, pushes the Exhorter into a merchandising of externals.

The Indian Wars are over, ended with the surrender of Geronimo in 1886. Benteen, now a drunk, picks fights with men he imagines are Mormons, and disrespects important women at Fort Duchesne. At his courtmartial, he tells the judges about his distinguished career in the Civil War. The prosecutor brings up the old charge that Benteen caused Custer's death at the Little Big Horn. Benteen retorts that it's Custer who has caused the death of Benteen.","http://media.podiobooks.com/glorious/PB-Glorious-01.mp3","2007-02-04 15:16:15","2009-11-01 19:15:56","1","1","0","Chapter 1","18008570","audio/mpeg","1180"
"50694","123","2","Benteen blames Custer's wife Libbie for spreading the story that Benteen had set Custer up to die.

On the way, in St. Louis, Custer, Libbie and Anna see a performance by Lawrence Barrett which reduces Custer to tears (something that happens to him often.) That night,after sex with Libbie (they have an extravagant physical relationship), Custer is not satisfied, and appears at Anna's door.","http://media.podiobooks.com/glorious/PB-Glorious-02.mp3","2007-02-04 15:16:15","2009-11-01 19:15:59","1","1","0","Chapter 2","9495635","audio/mpeg","1000"
"50695","123","3","Arriving the next day at Fort Riley, they are met by Major Alfred Gibbs, who commands the post. And waiting for Custer in Gibbs' dining room is General William Tecumseh Sherman. Sherman asks Custer if he misses the War. As Benteen tells it, Custer had hated to see it end. Beginning at Bull Run and ending with Lee's surrender at Appomattox, Custer had built a reputation for leading glorious charges and had been appointed the army's youngest volunteer brigadier general. But when the war ended, he had returned to his regular army rank of captain, and Libbie had insisted he find another career. He had gone to New York, where he'd met a general he had known in the war. The general cautioned him against leaving the army now. The transcontinental railroads were in the process of being built; they would run through Indian country, the army expected a fight, and there would be plenty for a cavalry soldier to do.","http://media.podiobooks.com/glorious/PB-Glorious-03.mp3","2007-02-04 15:16:15","2009-11-01 19:16:10","1","1","0","Chapter 3","14089529","audio/mpeg","931"

Disobeying orders to confine himself to rescuing the wood train, Fetterman charges up Lodge Trail Ridge following taunting Indians. As he comes down the other side of the ridge, Sioux and Cheyenne spring a trap. Fetterman and all his men are wiped out and horribly mutilated. In response, General Sherman sends General Hancock after the southern Cheyenne (who were not involved in the attack on Fetterman.)

Sioux and Cheyenne chiefs try to dissuade him from approaching the village; after Sand Creek, they were afraid for their women and children. The Indians burn the prairie grass to deny forage to the cavalry horses, send their women and children fleeing, and four hundred Indians form a line, ready to charge. But one of them puts up a white flag, and Hancock and Custer meet Chief Roman Nose between the armies. Hancock orders Roman Nose to bring back the women and children and to meet with the soldiers again closer to the Cheyenne camp. Soon Hancock's scouts report that all the Cheyenne have abandoned the camp. Hancock determines to burn it, but Wynkoop insists that if he does, he will be responsible for starting a war.

Custer concludes the Indians he has been tracking had committed the killings.

Out of food, Custer's column has to give up the chase and turn in to Fort Hays for supplies. They don't find the expected food and fodder at the fort, and desertions begin. Hancock appears at Fort Hays and castigates Custer for sitting there. Custer's depressed thoughts turn to Libbie and sex. When a sympathetic Colonel Smith agrees to bring Libbie to Fort Hays, Custer imposes strict punishment on the troops for minor infractions, intending to get them (and himself) in shape before Libbie appears. When Libbie appears, she and Custer ""go among the willows"" until Colonel Smith insists Custer resume the search for the Cheyenne, because Indians have been raiding parties working on the nearby Union Pacific tracks to the north.","http://media.podiobooks.com/glorious/PB-Glorious-09.mp3","2007-02-11 14:00:53","2009-11-01 19:17:55","1","1","0","Chapter 9","13051148","audio/mpeg","609"

"54920","123","33","On the Yellowstone River, three cavalry columns converge on the Sioux - Colonel John Gibbon from the west, General George Crook from the south, and Terry and Custer from the east. Terry expected to find the Sioux on the Little Missouri River - but they weren't there, so he moved his column west to the Powder River. There he learns that Gibbon has seen an indian camp on the Rosebud, farther west. Concerned to catch all the indians, Terry sends Major Marcus Reno up the Powder on a scout. Reno's orders, if he doesn't find indians on the Powder, are to march further west to the Tongue River and then up that river to the Yellowstone. He is under no circumstances to go near the camp Gibbon has seen on the Rosebud. Terry has sent Reno on the scout instead of Custer because he believes if Custer finds indians, he will attack them alone. Reno disobeys Terry's orders and marches to the Rosebud. He reports to Gibbon on June 18th that the indian camp there is empty, but it's big. There has been no word from Crook, so Terry decides to hold Gibbon on the Yellowstone as a northern blocking force and send Custer and the 7th Cavalry to move on the Sioux. Custer tells Mark Kellogg of his presidential plans. Mark Kellogg tells Custer that the Democratic Convention would meet in St. Louis on June 28th. Custer now knows how little time he has. He enlists Lonesome Charley to make the run to the Bozeman telegraph as soon as he has defeated the Sioux.","http://media.podiobooks.com/glorious/PB-Glorious-33.mp3","2007-06-03 13:04:59","2009-11-01 19:23:54","1","1","0","Chapter 33","14257382","audio/mpeg","461"

In their presence, you will often feel a drain of energy that is unexplainable.  When you yield to the illusionary authority of the Dark Brothers, you become a subject and source of their power.  You can easily neutralize any dark agent by completely releasing yourself from all his so-called authority and recognizing only one authority.  The key is to realize there is only one authority.  That authority is the Holy Spirit and can only be contacted from within.  If you are focused on the Spirit within, you will feel a confirmation within to help you discern that which is truth (light) versus that which is not (darkness).  I give John my best understanding of an answer at this point of who or what you are--that we are motion or action of some kind.

The urgency sets in that Elizabeth and I will have to do everything possible to solve the first key.  I seek out the input from a friend who knows New Age doctrines.  New Agers reason that we are basically gods who have forgotten we are gods.  It sounds too simple.  After falling asleep that night, I have an unusually vivid dream that incites some serious contemplation. The voice of God in the dream presents the possibility that John is not a true teacher but some kind of evil incarnate.  I must choose between the two Johns, but which is the true John?  When facing difficult decisions, go with that which is most real to your soul, and gives you peace instead of fear.

Then the bells...   Meeting up with John again (finally!) is of great moment with all the new questions I have.  John explains that if one always following the highest he knows--that is, follow the light of truth and the Holy Spirit within--he will find truth and avoid great illusion.  There must be opposition in all things: The Adversary and the Dark Brothers.  Is there really such a thing as a burning Hell?  The Disciples of Christ, or the Brotherhood of Light, always honor free will.  Unlike the Dark Brothers who exert force for selfish purposes.  The purpose of the outside world is to stimulate us with experience, and the purpose of the inner (God within) is to verify.  Both are necessary in understanding truth that exists in all things.","http://media.podiobooks.com/theimmortal/PB-TheImmortal-011.mp3","2007-07-27 10:29:12","2009-11-01 23:46:48","1","1","0","Chapter 11: The Reunion","21464879","audio/mpeg","320"

John smiled, \""Unrealized truth clearly presented can cause a great disturbance.  The master at this was Joshua, or Jesus.\""  Another hint from John: To better understand who and what you are it is helpful to know what you are not.

Elizabeth and I do our best to understand the meaning of John\'s instruction that I ask her if she had discovered the thoughts and fears she had been hiding from herself.  I feel that John might be on to something---that Elizabeth\'s illness is somehow related to hidden thoughts and fears that she has suppressed and maybe even forgot about.  Elizabeth reflects on some events during her childhood, which if they were never quite completely resolved, could be the suppression that her present illness stems from.","http://media.podiobooks.com/theimmortal/PB-TheImmortal-013.mp3","2007-07-27 10:29:12","2009-11-01 23:47:36","1","1","0","Chapter 13: Hidden Fears","10675263","audio/mpeg","317"

If we are a cell in the body of God we are not incorrect in saying we are Gods.  Do you think this is what Jesus meant when he He said ye are gods?  Even though everyone has a different idea as to what is God, life, and who we are, it makes sense that we could all become one in thought.

John presses for my answer the important question at hand, while he also discloses of a mission that I have ahead of me.  John provides another hint, which revolves around the mystery of God that I\'ve been contemplating.  What\'s in a name?  In the story of Moses, Moses asked God what his name was.  The standard translation in most Bibles states that God said \""I AM THAT I AM.\""  John illuminates that God has many names because He is many things to many people in many times, and changing.  Before being teleported back, I learn there are many disciples in the world that the Brotherhood of Light is working with in the purpose of assisting an evolving humanity.","http://media.podiobooks.com/theimmortal/PB-TheImmortal-015.mp3","2007-07-27 10:29:12","2009-11-05 11:37:19","1","1","0","Chapter 15: The Name of God","20985062","audio/mpeg","305"

The John imposter said I AM SELF. I, the self, is all that matters.  However, to those who are good, self is not the ultimate.  It is the connection with all other selves which is the ultimate.  We seem to be getting closer to an answer.

The true singing of the Song of the 144,000 is accomplished on three levels: the physical, emotional and mental planes, which opens the door of the spiritual.  John states that my time is up, and I must now provide him the right key word to answer the Question.  If I don\'t have it, our relationship is at an end.  John and I sat in silence, and during that interlude I did not have to ask him if the key word was correct.  I knew it was as the inner voice confirmed it to me.  Never let fear of failure prevent you from taking action. Remember the lesson of the parable. Always take action on the highest you know and you will learn from your mistakes and eventually meet with success. Learn to trust what the Spirit confirms to you.  John explains the first stage of my mission is to write several books giving out new teachings and keys to the world.  Even though everyone has a different idea as to what is God, life, and who we are, it makes sense that we could all become one in thought.

Whether he likes it or not, fate is coming for Aston and it\'s about to lead him to places he never expected to go.

As chaotic and random as the city it inhabits, Electricity is about to drag Aston from Australia to Seville to his Battersea Bedsit. Ultimately, he will find himself entwined in a mystery bigger than the universe itself. Being of a somewhat useless persuasion, Aston will do his very best to ignore it.

It\'s not quite the original outline, but this second half especially contains pretty much the raw ideas as I was first writing them down. Plot points and other story elements changed between this and the finished books and so, once again, this outline reads like a summary of the trilogy that gets some things wrong! This second half covers the end of \""Vatican Ambassador\"" and all of \""Vatican Abdicator\"". Following the \""Future of the Future\"" are two additional outlines, the \""Alien Timeline\"" and the history of \""The Project\"".

"71389","395","1","FOREWORD by Pastor Kenneth V. Blanchard, Sr., read by the good pastor. 

A hip Baptist preacher tells you why you don\'t have to be afraid of Michael Dean, even though Michael doesn\'t believe in Christ. And you also needn\'t be afraid that Michael believes in SOMETHING if you believe in NOTHING. This ain\'t about changing your mind, it\'s about improving your life. 

CHAPTER ONE, Greetings Eager Seeker, read by the author, Michael W. Dean. 

Michael explains what you\'re in for (it\'s all good!), how he teaches (more like a friend sitting next to you than like a textbook), and what this book is about (cutting deadwood out of your life, getting rid of bad patterns, habits, and people. Then we teach you how to work smarter once you’ve cleaned house).","http://media.podiobooks.com/mwdean55/PB-UsersManual-01.mp3","2009-05-27 09:32:23","2009-11-04 18:33:00","1","1","0","FOREWORD and Chapter One, Greetings Eager Seeker","16909104",,"314"

We define \""who this book is for\"" (hint: about 85% of the world, but not everyone.)

We learn that everything in life, in living right, really boils down to only TWO RULES, and that\'s all you need to live by. We cheerfully explore these rules at length: their history, their implementation and application. (We also learn a little about computer privacy, because that\'s the way Michael teaches.

We learn why HOME IS WHERE THE RIGHTS ARE, and learn to recognize and block MATH WORMS. 

Here we offer practical experience, strength and hope to live a life that has less of people imposing their will on you. And we begin to talk about how we will MAKE A LIVING DOING WHAT WE LOVE after we get rid of the idiots and problems that are avoidable.

"75201","405","2","While visiting her Aunt, Tory is taken by a picture of a man and an oxcart in the dining room of the house. That night, she has a dream about it that wakes her up. The dream makes her so curious about the painting that she needs to see it. She is surprised to meet her cousin Jeremy in the dining room. Then, with Tory leading the way, the two of them venture into - and through - the painting.

In the new world Tory meets Karen and Paul. They help Tory and her cousin by taking them in to their house. Tory is amazed and confused to see that Jeremy already knows both Karen and Paul. She asks them about it and Karen tells her he\'s been helping out the man in the picture.

The next morning, Tory and Jeremy leave Karen and Paul\'s home, and head over the mountains to help the man with the oxcart. In the mountains frozen rain begins to fall. Hoping for some shelter, they come upon a large castle.","http://media.podiobooks.com/qbb/PB-QuiltBookAndBard-02.mp3","2009-06-17 10:30:41","2009-11-05 04:25:45","1","1","0","Transition","13662654",,"111"
"75202","405","3","Once in the castle, Jeremy goes exploring, leaving Tory in the entrance hall. While she waits for him to return, a strange man shows up. Though she is scared, Tory holds her own by offering the man food and a warm sweater. He takes both the food and the sweater, but tries to bolt when Jeremy comes back from his exploration and tells Tory how he\'s found a place where he thinks someone must be sleeping, Jeremy finally notices the man Tory is struggling to keep with her. When Jeremy asks the man who he is, the man gives no answer.

Deciding the man isn\'t worth the effort Tory lets him go. Jeremy and Tory try to leave the castle. Appearing before them, the man introduces himself as Neal and explains that Hildegard (the name of the castle) won\'t allow them to leave unless they pledge to return to the castle when they are finished with their journey. Jeremy is skeptical since Neal claims he\'s been in Castle Hildegard for 200 hundred years.

Though neither Tory nor Jeremy are particularly inclined to believe Neal, they follow along and pledge to the castle to return once they help the man with the oxcart. As part of the deal Hildegard tells them they must take Neal along with them.","http://media.podiobooks.com/qbb/PB-QuiltBookAndBard-03.mp3","2009-06-17 10:31:07","2009-11-05 04:25:46","1","1","0","Hildegard","23122742",,"113"

King Delphic hears from his messenger that Jeremy, Tory and Neal are no longer on their way to help his son with the oxcart. The messenger wonders if the King is going too far in his quest to make the spell focused on keeping the kingdoms together.

Garten drags Tory, Jeremy and Neal from one Inn to the next, as he brings them closer to King Delphic. On his way he captures one other person, Jake, who turns out to be the man with the oxcart Tory and Jeremy were trying to help.","http://media.podiobooks.com/qbb/PB-QuiltBookAndBard-04.mp3","2009-06-17 10:31:26","2009-11-05 04:25:59","1","1","0","Captured","26207699",,"107"

    Several moments later, two men in white labcoats came in the room and peppered Nick with questions:

                    

    “So how often do you eat?” one asked — he did not introduce himself but Nick immediately thought of him as Doctor Flanksteak.

                    

    “Three squares a day, chief.”

                    

    “Good, and how many servings of fruit do you have per diem?”

                    

    “Well, if I’m feeling Latin, sometimes I’ll have a glass of orange juice, and occasionally an apple.”

                    

    “Fine. We just need to know,” the other scientist said, whom Nick thought of as Mr. Squeeze, Master of Constriction.

                    

    Dr. Flanksteak and Mr. Squeeze proceeded to ask him many questions, most of which Nick answered truthfully.

                    

    To the question: “Have you ever had a hallucination, vision or other psychotic episode,” Nick said, “No.”

                    

    They believed him, which just goes to show how good an actor Nick
                    was, because at that very moment, the dreadful maw of the komodo dragon
                    was superimposed over Dr. Flanksteak’s face.

In Episode Three (chapters six, seven and eight), we are introduced
                to the bit players in the novel — Seedy, Spider, Blossom and Hippolyta,
                Ted Shute’s giant-booted emo daughter. The narrator, Rob explains what
                The Cult of the Claw is all about, and we learn what Nick is thinking
                as he writes his e-journal in his beloved Titania3000.
                

An excerpt from Nick’s journal:

                

    In the lab they asked me questions. Deep questions and I
                    hid the answers. Like I do every day, except with you, my lovely
                    Titania3000!

                    

    Happily, the scientists decided to proceed. And they swabbed the
                    lower end of my spine with Novocain, stinging, then numb. And in went a
                    deep needle, fushed my fish, mealed my monkey, and deeper went the vile
                    liquid that they wanted to test on me. It did no harm, except to say
                    that now there is a large, swollen bump there, very near the base of my
                    spine. It is tender. And red. Delicate like the prose in monkeyjoy!

                    

    It proceeds in another file, a digital brother to this record of my
                    transformation. Who knows, perhaps someday it will be done and we can
                    all have soup for our souls – and not just of the chicken noodle
                    variety!

In Episode Four (chapters one, two and
                three), Rob meets the “threateningly slender” Ariadne, friend of
                Hippolyta Shute, unhappy worker at the Consume-It! drugstore, and a
                beautiful person. Then we see Spider and Seedy as they plan a caper
                (badly). And finally, we learn more about the a-hole Shute (who you may
                not be surprised to learn drives a Porsche.)
                

An excerpt from chapter one:

                

    Ariadne Thipirous worked at the Consume-It! drugstore
                    near Bland Street and Dead White Guy Avenue. I think it would be fair
                    to say that she hated working there as much she hated the idea of
                    needing a special cream for toe fungus, but despite that, she was
                    polite and pleasant with almost everyone who purchased something from
                    the store. It was not their fault that they needed genetically modified
                    foods, mood drugs, panty liners, jock itch cream and many other useful
                    items that kept the minor evils of life at bay. Well, it was their
                    fault, but she could hardly blame them for it without feeling like a
                    hypocrite, particularly as she was working there.","http://media.podiobooks.com/marvelloushairy/PB-marvelloushairy-04.mp3","2009-09-07 19:56:47","2009-11-04 21:15:57","1","1","0","MarvellousHairy 04","25505017",,"76"

In Episode Five (chapters four and
                five), Rob and Nick meet Seedy and Spider for an “exchange”, and then
                go to the Hated University to meet their friend Erma. The three old
                friends go to dinner at a place by the harbour called the Itchy Crab,
                where Nick regales them with tales of what his inner monkey can
                accomplish, and he and Erma fall in love. In chapter five, we see more
                of the bit players Blossom, Hippolyta, Mrs. Moth and Starveling, as
                they discuss what is to be done about the psychopathic Spider.
                

An excerpt from chapter four:

                

    Nick was bugging me. He was making me feel stupid. Most
                    of the time I think of him as a creative madman — sometimes as a
                    visionary. I don’t really know any other visionaries, so I’m not sure
                    what they’re supposed to be like, but I didn’t think so strange. Nick
                    let his laugh turn into a kind of bark. A chattering kind of yap, and
                    the next thing I knew he was standing on top of the table, slapping his
                    chest like a gorilla and making these weird snorting, barking, laughing
                    sounds. He was putting it on, of course, but it was odd — odd enough to
                    bring the owner of the Itchy Crab over, who asked him to stop it.
                    (Funny, you’d think someone who could name their seafood restaurant the
                    Itchy Crab would have a sense of humor.)

                    

    Nick pretended to groom the owner’s hairpiece, and then sat down
                    before the man got really angry. Erma was rocking in her chair, she was
                    laughing so hard.","http://media.podiobooks.com/marvelloushairy/PB-marvelloushairy-05.mp3","2009-09-07 19:57:14","2009-11-04 21:16:06","1","1","0","MarvellousHairy 05","23070378",,"78"

"75767","428","6","In Episode Six (Part II – The Human Ideal – chapters six to nine),
                we witness two separate cab rides — one in which Rob is lectured by the
                cabbie on the importance of love, and another in which we can see love
                beginning between Nick and Erma. Rob finally arrives at his
                destination, St. Dymphna’s Hospital, where Dr. Tundra works, and where
                Rob plays a special prank on the maniac psych doc/chemical Magellan. In
                chapter nine, we return to Nick’s journal, and his thoughts on the day,
                writing, and new-found love.
                

Another excerpt from Nick’s journal (chapter nine):

                

    \""A wise man once wrote: “Love looks not with the eyes but
                    with the mind.” And thank the stars that it be so, for I could see that
                    her eyes saw not my pudgy middle, but my middle eye, the flashing
                    knowledge that I have of the subconscious world and true art. I saw, it
                    as though by lightning. Strobes and flickers of a shape that lashes out
                    at me with tendrils of love and pain — a deep sea creature with arms
                    both toxic and tender.

                    

    A great day, and even better for all that it was a lizard-day,
                    normally so mundane and about my basic needs. But those have been met.
                    Seedy paid the full price, the agreed price, and the physiology lab
                    paid more than they agreed, and now there is time to do nothing but
                    write. Oh, that and visit the glass penis for my next spinal injection.\""

Eric Moore confirms the suspicions of Thiel and Agent Unes:  the computers were the key--or rather, the e-mail from \""God\"" was the key to the terror events of 10/13.  Just as Thiel and his men leave to plan their next move, a tall, round-faced man with thinning hair arrives at the Moores\' home, announces that his name is Barney Ison, and he\'s there to help.","http://media.podiobooks.com/thegodconspiracy/PB-GodConspiracy-20.mp3","2009-09-22 00:18:15","2009-11-05 20:30:07","1","1","0","The God Conspiracy: Epidsode 19","25736499",,"365"

"75839","428","7","Episode Seven — Part Three (chapters one to three): This episode is
                all about intimate conversations: a megalomaniac talks with his ghost,
                and we learn what’s going to happen to Nick. The monkey-man discovers
                the lure of the banana, and so does Helena, VP, Marketing, Gargantuan
                Enterprises. And in chapter three, the VP learns that her boss, the
                Megalomaniac and CEO of Gargantuan Enterprises (not his actual title)
                might be crazy and yes, is planning to launch a weather-controlling
                satellite.
                

An excerpt from chapter two.  Nick has run into Helena at the Gargantuan Enterprises building, and they have a coffee together:

                

    They managed to get the same table where Helena and I
                    had sat before, and talked for a while about the weather. Midway
                    through his coffee, Nick got up and went back to the counter where he
                    bought a banana. The thought of it had been haunting him since he had
                    ordered his cappuccino.

                    

    “So what study are you participating in?”

                    

    “Hmm. Not allowed to talk about it. There’s a helmet involved and
                    everything,” Nick said, and then pointed to his banana. “Would you like
                    to taste this? It’s incredible. It tastes like no other banana I’ve
                    ever had in my life, I mean —” he took another bite, and chewed, his
                    eyes rolling back into his head with pleasure. “I mean, this is fucking
                    fabulous,” Nick exclaimed. “Sorry,” he smiled, a winning grin, “I
                    didn’t mean to hog it all. Here, have a bite.”

                    

    He offered the banana to Helena, and she was extremely conscious of
                    his hand holding it as her lips surrounded the pale flesh of the fruit.
                    Her face flushed, and she took a bite, self-consciously. It tasted like
                    a banana, but the accompanying rush of blood to her face, and other
                    regions, gave it an extra zest.

                    

    “Mmm,” she said.

                    

    “Yeah!” Nick finished the fruit, and got up to buy another one.","http://media.podiobooks.com/marvelloushairy/PB-marvelloushairy-07.mp3","2009-09-23 08:53:16","2009-11-04 21:17:08","1","1","0","MarvellousHairy 07","24114644",,"69"
"75840","428","8","Episode Eight — Part Three (Chapter four): In this episode we gather
                for a nice evening out, with Rob, Nick and Max. The good news is that
                Rob happens to run into Ariadne at the pub. The bad news is that Max
                drops acid, gets “the Sauce” and has a meaningful experience with a
                cactus. Oh, and Nick is pretty weird too. But Rob is definitely falling
                for Ariadne.
                

An excerpt: 

                


                    Meanwhile Max came out of his bedroom, dressed in some running shorts
                    and a singlet. His green eyes looked scary, the pupils tiny despite the
                    duskiness of the room. Nick calmed down again, and Max poured himself a
                    scotch. He sat down, and immediately said, “Holy shit. Look at the
                    fucking cactus!”

                    

    “What about the cactus?” I asked.

                    

    “I mean, look at it. How can you miss it?”

                    

    Nick sensed Max’s fascination, and he started staring at it too. It
                    was like they weren’t there, and Ariadne and I started talking.

                    

    “Do they do this often?”

                    

    “Hardly ever. Nick especially. I have to say, I’m really surprised.
                    Tundra is a freak. He probably does this more than he should, but I’m
                    not usually with him when he does, so I couldn’t tell you how
                    frequently.”

                    

    “It’s nice that you look out for your friends.”

                    

    “Ah, I’ll tease them mercilessly tomorrow. And for the foreseeable future.”

                    

    “Yeah, but you know.” She slid closer to me on the couch.

Episode Nine — Part Three (Chapters four to eight): This slightly
                shorter episode is all about being shaken down, stood up, and freaked
                out. In chapter four, Seedy and Spider put their kidnapping plan in to
                action, causing Hippolyta to be both amused and terrified. Ariadne
                stands up Shute, and we discover that he’s even colder than we thought.
                Erma isn’t exactly stood up by Nick, but she sure is worried about him,
                as she should be. We end with another update to Nick’s journal, in his
                Titania3000.
                

An excerpt from his journal: 

                


                    Friends are so lovely. You feel safer around them. I like their smells,
                    even the disgusting ones. You know they’re safe, not like the strange
                    smells outside. The scary smells of all those throngs of people walking
                    and laughing and hurting one another in the world. So many of them.

                    I am so itchy. My body seems to be covered in tiny dark hairs, darker than normal.

                past the (potty-mouthed) guard at the elevator. Meanwhile, Shute
                springs a hell of a question on Helena, but allows her to talk to Larry
                the Letch, who is the lead researcher turning Nick into a monkey.
                

An excerpt from chapter one, as Rob tries to visit Helena, and is prevented by the security guard:

                


                    “That’s not a valid ID, sir,” he said. His voice had a little more of
                    an edge to it now, as though he was saying to me, “I may be a security
                    guard, but I’m not an idiot.” I didn’t think he was an idiot. Really. I
                    would never assume that about someone just because of their job. “What
                    is your business on the upper floors, sir.” 

                    

    He kept saying “sir” like it was some kind of insult, I mean, I’m
                    sure he was saying “sir” but the subtext was all different. Actually,
                    what I heard was different. So while he said, “What is your business on
                    the upper floors, sir,” what I heard was, “What is your business on the
                    upper floors, you lying sack of shit.” 

                    

    It kind of threw me.","http://media.podiobooks.com/marvelloushairy/PB-marvelloushairy-10.mp3","2009-10-06 20:10:44","2009-11-04 21:18:12","1","1","0","MarvellousHairy 10","16209785",,"74"

                kidnapping victim’s help, how to get something out of Shute.
                

Excerpt from chapter three, while Helena and Rob plot their coup: 

                

    I laughed again. It was easy to forget that Hot Helena
                    was also really funny. She could definitely do much better than Shute,
                    but she hadn’t been trying. From what I could tell, Helena had spent
                    the last ten years working really hard.

                    

    “So, I have a couple of things to ask,” I said.

                    

    “Why don’t you let me start? I’ve learned a little bit about what Nick’s doing here.”

                    

    “Really?”

                    

    “Yes,” she said. “I’m supposed to have dinner with the guy who’s
                    running the program Nick is in tonight, so I’ll have details, but he’s
                    altering DNA. They’ve already done it to other animals.”

                    

    “You mean, like, in vitro animals. Cloning?”

                    

    “No. Live animals. The Letch seemed proud of that. They’re changing
                    the DNA of live animals. They’ve already done their work with lower
                    animals, and they’re starting on humans.”

                    

    “Holy shit.”

                    

    “I think that’s what’s happening to Nick,” Helena said.

                    

    “What are they doing?”

                    

    “That I don’t know. Fucking with his DNA. The Letch said something
                    about wanting to upgrade chimps, so from that, my guess is that they’re
                    regressing their human subjects.”

                    

    “Regressing?”

                    

    “Did you ever watch Star Trek?”

                    

    “Uh, yeah.”

                    

    “Remember the one where Riker turns into a caveman and Worf starts spraying poison all over the crew as they also deevolve?”

                    

    “Oh Helena. The Next Generation?”

                    

    “Yeah,” she said. “What? The middle seasons were good!”

                    

    “A hottie who watches Star Trek. Even The Next Generation. How did I not date you?”

                    

    “You never asked, bonehead. And that ship has sailed, so don’t get any ideas.”","http://media.podiobooks.com/marvelloushairy/PB-marvelloushairy-11.mp3","2009-10-13 23:27:30","2009-11-04 21:18:18","1","1","0","MarvellousHairy 11","18538651",,"68"

                Ghost of Johnny can speak a little Latin.
                

An excerpt of Rob waiting at a Starbucks for his new love:

                

    “I’ll wait for you at the Den of Ubiquity,” I whispered, “next door.”

                    

    I liked the chain’s coffee, though I’m not a connoisseur. I’m not
                    sure you need four or five of them within a one-block radius, no matter
                    how addicted to their brand of caffeine you might be. Perhaps it is the
                    marvellous decor that people can’t get enough of — too bad you can only
                    sit in one at a time, though I suppose if they put webcams in each
                    store you could “enjoy” them all at once.

                    

    The barista was fetching, there was no doubt, even if I was already
                    smitten with Ariadne. Now, you must remember, I had not been in a
                    “relationship” for some time, and I was yet to get into that mindset. I
                    noticed her making the coffee right away. Perhaps it was her
                    overwhelming competence — she only had to hear a customer ask for a
                    double-milk-latte-half-caf-mocha-frappa-dappa-doolay once, and she had
                    the order — but I think it was her distracted, yet annoyed smile that
                    did it for me. It could have been her voluptuous figure, of which I
                    could only see the top half. Perhaps it was the man-juice flowing in my
                    veins. So, I had no reservations about sitting there, sipping my Kenyan
                    High-land Roast Orgasm, or whatever it was called, while Ariadne
                    finished her shift.

                    

    She arrived in time to rescue our budding romance from my fickle
                    male nature. When she walked in, looking as dignified as any upright
                    hominid can in a polyester uniform adorned with the Consume-It! logo; I
                    forgot all about the angry barista.\""","http://media.podiobooks.com/marvelloushairy/PB-marvelloushairy-12.mp3","2009-10-21 09:01:22","2009-11-04 21:18:46","1","1","0","MarvellousHairy 12","23880172",,"70"

                giving her some hope of surviving the whole caper. Rob, Ariadne,

                things in a new way.
                

An excerpt:

                

    \""As we were going over the notes again, a picture emerged
                    of where Hippolyta was — not from good detective work, though the
                    skeptics amongst you will say that’s what it was. I just saw it. I
                    thought I could smell the Shade of Antonia’s perfume as an image of an
                    old husk of an apartment building filled my mind.

                    

    I described it to everyone, almost like I was reading the
                    description from a kidnapper’s guide book: “The Skanky Apartments, down
                    in the un-gentrified part of the docklands are a perfect setting for
                    any kind of shady endeavour, but if you plan to kidnap and freakishly
                    dismember an heiress, you couldn’t ask for a nicer location. There’s no
                    people around, there’s lots of ambiance, and the rooms are decorated in
                    the original retro style. Just add fungus and decay and you have
                    felonious magic!”

                    

    Everyone looked at me the way they did when the first saw Nick, post monkeyfication.\""","http://media.podiobooks.com/marvelloushairy/PB-marvelloushairy-13.mp3","2009-10-28 09:05:54","2009-11-05 08:00:35","1","1","0","MarvellousHairy 13","22591604",,"58"

Spider and Seedy finally come to the Kunfu-riffic conclusion to
                their kidnapping caper, learning all about Japanese sword-making,
                physics and why acrylic ski masks suck. In chapter two, the gang
                finally puts their plan into action, and they capture the King of the
                Gag, learning that he has some seriously lizardfish proclivities. And
                that two women kissing is not as hot as it first sounds.
                

An excerpt from the kidnapping, as Shute arrives at Helena’s apartment:

                

    \""The idea was that Max and I were going to get into
                    Helena’s closet and wait for their signal. They hoped to get Shute to
                    agree to being tied up, as part of their little three-some. If that
                    went off without a hitch, then it should make things considerably
                    easier.

                    

    We all had another drink together, to kill the last twenty minutes
                    before Shute was due to arrive. No doubt he would be fashionably late.
                    By one pm, we were all keyed up. I don’t mind telling you there was an
                    awkward psycho-sexual energy in the room, not at all dampened by
                    another round of scotch. Honza Chodets was tasting better and better.

                    

    I was so wound up, I almost dropped my scotch, when at five-to-one,
                    there was a knock at the door. Helena grabbed our drinks, poured them
                    into the sink, and shooed us into her bedroom, where Max and I got into
                    the walk-in closet. Ariadne waited in the bedroom, looking at me
                    through the slats in Helena’s closet doors.

                    

    Helena let Shute in and his eyebrows actually arched when he saw
                    what she was wearing. “Where’s Thipirous?” he asked. “I hope she’s not
                    dressed as provocatively as you Borovich, or my heart might not be able
                    to take it.”\""","http://media.podiobooks.com/marvelloushairy/PB-marvelloushairy-14.mp3","2009-10-30 09:33:48","2009-11-05 09:47:04","1","1","0","MarvellousHairy 14","24761228",,"54"

After they move Shute, Helena and Max have an ethical discussion
                about kidnapping, medical malpractice, and branding. The media
                conference is more like a circus, as the media isn’t exactly on its
                best behavior. And then Rob gets to watch while the Ghosts have their
                revenge. In the end, they all live, happily, and ever after. Though
                Nick still has something to say through his lovely Titania3000.

                

An excerpt from Dr. Tundra and Helena’s discussion of branding: 

                

    “Seriously. You like scotch, right? So say you buy a
                    cer-tain brand and we know that there’s this other brand that is just
                    as good, but less expensive. We can help you find that other brand,”
                    Helena said

                    

    “Hmm. Single malt kind of defies the brand concept, I think,” Max replied.

                    

    “No, not at all. In fact, single malt is a great example of the
                    power of the brand. We all know that Glenfiddich is a good scotch, but
                    there are lots of other single malts that are better. But everyone
                    knows Glenfiddich — even people who don’t like single malt scotch —
                    because of the strength of its brand. It’s not just the actual product,
                    it’s about the feelings you have for the product. And that’s because
                    they were branding their scotch before people even knew what branding
                    was.”

                    

    “So what is Gargantuan’s brand?”

                    

    “That’s the problem I have with Shute.”

                    

    “That’s your problem? Not the fact that he’s just messed with Nick’s
                    DNA?” Max said. He looked at Shute contemptuously, and for a moment
                    Helena thought he might kick the partially conscious man.

                    

    “Well, that too, but he’s not building the Gargantuan brand.”

                    

    “You’ve helped kidnap him because of branding?”

                    

    “Oh, no, I have other reasons too, but that is my corporate reason for doing so.”","http://media.podiobooks.com/marvelloushairy/PB-marvelloushairy-15.mp3","2009-10-30 09:34:29","2009-11-06 00:14:35","1","1","0","MarvellousHairy 15","25581684",,"55"
