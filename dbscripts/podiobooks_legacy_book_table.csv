It\'s the 1980s in Boston: the Celtics are rolling, the Patriots got crushed by the Bears, and the Sox are the Sox. Adam Berkman is learning how far from the warm feelings and epiphanies of Disney Americana his life can be when his parents get a divorce and he has to change schools almost every year. In this collection of linked stories, Seth Harwood takes you on a tour of Boston and its suburbs as he brings you more of the strong, clear writing you found in Jack Wakes Up.

Author Tom Evslin, a serial CEO, also took a company public in the Internet bubble and fought off hostile takeover attempts in the subsequent rubble. Unlike Larry, Evslin lived to tell what may be the definitive story of those strange times.

The mystery moves backwards and forwards around the time of Larry\'s death. Sex, power, money, farce, and tragedy mix in boardrooms and bedrooms, the parties of the World Economic Forum in Davos, and the smoky stairway of the South Tower of the World Trade Center.

hackoff.com - not a porn site - provides anti-hacker protection for e-commerce. Larry Lazard started the business after his release from prison to which he was sentenced for a confessed hacker attack on banks.

The folks at hackoff track the company\'s stock price with fatal fascination; an online chat board provides a Greek chorus of contradictory explanations and expectations; analysts spin golden fantasies from websites and eyeballs; traders conjure real fortunes at their trading desks; and everyone who can clamors for \""friends and family\"" stock.

hackoff.com\'s characters include CFO Donna Langhorne, Larry\'s ex-lover and classmate from Harvard Business School and a former swimsuit model; Chief Technical Officer Dom Montain, who dropped out of Caltech to write video games; Detective Mark Cohen, NYPD, who\'s investigating Larry\'s death; Larry\'s wife Louise, who is certain her husband was murdered; and Ahmed Qali, who represents a group of Palestinian programmers in Jenin to which hackoff out-sources work. Along with the bankers, CEOs, and CFOs of dotcom America, are eavesdropping limo drivers and waiters, venture capitalists, hackers, terrorists, and the victims and heroes of 9/11.

If you\'ve ever wanted to be a fly on the wall of the boardrooms, private jets, and ornate meeting rooms of brokerage firms, hackoff.com gives you your chance. You\'ll be better prepared for the next bubble if you read this book but that\'s not why you\'ll eagerly download each online episode. You\'ll do that because the cleverly woven mystery will have you dying to know whodunit.","Tom Evslin","http://hackoff.com",,"0","hackoffcomcover.jpg","0","5","0","hackoff","0","1","http://www.podiobooks.com/blog/2006/02/01/hackoffcom/",,,,,,,"0","0","2.05882","2.41176","3.29412","2.88235","by-nc-nd","Literature",NULL,NULL,NULL

EarthCore is the company with the technology, the resources and the guts to go after the mother lode. Young executive Connell Kirkland is the company\'s driving force, pushing himself and those around him to uncover the massive treasure.

But Kirkland and EarthCore are not the first to find this treasure. The mountain\'s history reveals two centuries of disappearances, murder, and insanity.

The discovery of ancient platinum knives, razor-sharp despite lying untouched for 1,000 years, reveals evidence of an ancient culture. If the artifacts are genuine, they show a pre-historic empire that once spanned from the Southern tip of South America all the way up through the American Southwest.

Wealth and fame lie under that Utah mountain, but at three miles below the surface, where the rocks are so hot they burn bare skin, something has been waiting for centuries. Waiting ... and guarding. Kirkland and EarthCore are about to find out first-hand why this treasure has never been unearthed.

They have tough days just like humans do and their frustration is growing. Don't believe it? Well, what about Lucifer, the prince of darkness, who runs a car dealership--what about his feelings when he is faced with that impossible sale and he can't get that signature on form 666, the standard soul contract? Or maybe you wondered about how an extremely vain alien copes with having a bad hair day as he tries to alter the future of Earth? Will his cosmetic problems be our problems in other ways? Perhaps you heard about the opposite vampire who loves to give blood, hates the darkness and has a fetish for garlic - how does he get through a bad relationship? How about a DNA altered cat that has been given the personality of one of the world's most fearsome criminals? Will its human owners understand or will it be a less then purr-fect arrangement? 

What's the common thread do all this discontent, you ask? What is it about most stories that stay the same? It's the human! These aliens and demonic creatures are sick and tired of being the second fiddle in the story. They want what everybody wants: to be the center of attention of the stories instead of the pesky humans for a change...and now they finally get their wish. In Aliens and Satanic Creatures Wanted: Humans Need Not Apply, they finally get top billing and they exploit it as far as they can.

The quest is why we get up early in the mornings or very late at night and leave the safety of our homes and families. We venture out into a world where the rules are different then the rules we grew up with. We find that the rules are different than the ones we were taught in school. We get into our cars. We hail taxi cabs. We walk in the rain. We take trains and buses. We navigate security lines at crowded airports.

"38","The Wonderful Wizard of Oz","2005-11-20 08:23:32","1","0","From the Reader, Jason Pomerantz:

The Wonderful Wizard of Oz has been called \""the first true American fairy tale\"" and it richly deserves the title.  The story of Dorothy\'s epic journey through a strange land, filled with terrifying enemies and loyal allies, resonates today as much as it did when it was first written, at the turn of the last century.

You\'ve probably seen the movie countless times, so you might not expect any surprises from the book.  But when you listen, you\'ll be charmed by how imaginative it is, and in a way that\'s different from the film.

I dearly love the movie, but, in this reading, I\'ve tried to approach the story as if I\'d never seen it.  My Dorothy is a little younger than her cinematic counterpart and her trio of beloved friends - The Scarecrow, The Tin Woodsman and The Cowardly Lion - are all just a little sillier.  It\'s hard to escape from the shadow of the MGM spectacular, but I\'ve done my best.
I hope you have as much fun listening as I\'m having recording!

So sit back, put on your slippers (ruby, silver or whatever color you like) and watch out for flying monkeys!  Load up your MP3 player and remember - There\'s no place like home!

- Ernest Hogan, author of Smoking Mirror Blues

A top-secret AI project.

A deadly power struggle between warlords.

Tomi was once lead combat programmer for the Shogun Ryogi, on the front lines of his conflict against President William the Black of Cerberus. When she failed to prevent William from killing the samurai she loved, she abandoned all sides, all loyalties, all hope. In her fury, Tomi destroyed the Greatship, Hades IV, and almost everyone onboard. Almost everyone. . .

William the Black escaped with his life.

She now hides out in a remote monastery, awaiting the day when she can kill the three she holds responsible for the death of her samurai:  William, Ryogi, and herself. . .

With her real body in exile, Tomi\'s consciousness inhabits a deteriorating clone body on a satellite around Cerberus. She\'s lived and worked incognito in orbit for almost three years now, monitoring the planet\'s subspace debris cleanup.

But some histories will not stay buried.

Tomi again finds herself in the crossfire when Ryogi\'s forces ambush the Presidential shuttle in her sector.

Ryogi\'s samurai have pirated remote control of her satellite\'s store of dormant clone bodies; his combat programmers fight her for the station\'s computers, while the planet\'s extrasphere swarms with deadly smart-mines. Will she be able to protect the President\'s shuttle to secure her own vengeance? Will she be able to hold her satellite together? Or will Tomi abandon it all and give in to despair?

There\'s an epic struggle to throw away an old garbage can.

There are embarrassing incidents involving a very rude laptop computer.

There\'s a heroic quest to overcome parental objections and acquire an upgraded version of a violent computer game.

There are profound metaphysical breakthroughs revealed in the dentist\'s chair.

Or is he a sad old man who lives in a dream world inside his head?  It\'s a tale both comic and tragic, inspiring and pathetic.  Some might even say...  quixotic.

April 18, 1985 -- Into a world already wound tight with the desperate tensions of the Cold War comes a man with a startling Declaration: Metahumans exist, they demand autonomy, and Dr. William Karl Donner has the reality-bending power to enforce their status.  The balance of power is thrown askew by the addition of not one more Superpower, but <em>six thousand</em>.

Before the Donner Declaration, high school sophomore Nate Charters was just an outsider and self-proclaimed freak.  His unusual appearance, hair-trigger reflexes, and overactive metabolism should have made him something special, but his differences and low self-esteem have long since marked him as a target for the jocks and popular kids.

Now, just as his unique nature brings him the attention of a self-assured older girl, Nate must find his place in the world.  Why is he the way he is?  Where did he come from?  Is he part of a remarkable, powerful new minority... or just a misfit among misfits?

He\'d better find out fast...  others want the truth, and they\'re closing in...

""Even the smallest children knew about the story of The Darkening. It was a cautionary tale to remind everyone of what the damages of blind ambition can cause. Children would listen with their eyes wide open in terror as they imagined the wrath of God being unfurled upon the unwitting people who had dared to defy their own limitations. The programmers were powerful people that could control steel and wield vast creations at their fingertips, but when they discovered that humans were the result of complex programming and design, it was only natural that soon they would let their curiosity cause them to tamper. A new type of programmer was born, they were called geneticists.

It started off innocently; the programmers first decided that they would fix the inherent design flaws of their own programming. They understood the algorithms of what it meant to be human, but they weren't listening to the musical complexity in its entirety. Many people across the ancient world hailed the programmers of genetics and looked forward to ushering in a new era of humans that lacked flaws and defects. When parents wanted to have children they could pick out what kind of children they wanted, or even their pets or their food that they would consume.

Humans were modified intrinsically so that they would be resistant to damage, grow stronger, and live longer. Within a hundred years there wasn't an aspect of civilization that wasn't altered by the geneticists and their tampering.

But during all of this modification that the geneticists accomplished they were all surprised when they realized that there was a flaw they had overlooked...""

And his experience as an Army correspondent in Vietnam (1970-71) offered clues to the demands a new generation of America's youth would face in the 21st century.  Route 66 to Vietnam:  A Draftee's Story traces the fate of Mark Landon and other children from Growing Up on Route 66 (an earlier novel in the Route 66 Novel Series) through Southeast Asia and on to prosperous--if troubled--times later in life.

    Successful highway engineer Mark Landon is irritated by a sore tooth, by a rebellious teenage son, by a daughter's lack of interest in her promising athletic career, by his wife's apparent indifference to his needs, and by Ralph Banister, whose land is blocking the path of the highway Mark must build.  Beneath these everyday worries, however, memories of his time in Vietnam are stirring.  To survive a mid-life crisis, he begins to fear that he must not only confront the challenges of the present but also the ghosts of his wartime experiences.  In doing so he learns surprising things about his wife's past, about his children's abilities, and about Ralph Banister's vision for America.

But the truth is that Wilkes was the matinee idol of his time; and the attack on Lincoln was not the act of a maniac, but a part of a plan developed at the highest levels of the Confederacy.

In \""Consider the Elephant,\"" by Aram Schefrin, the story of Wilkes\'
life and death is told by his brother, Edwin Booth, called \""Ned.\"" Ned was the greatest Shakespearean actor of his age, as was their father Junius in his era; and their brother June was an actor, too, though less successful than his brothers. The story is soaked in the ambiance of life in the American theater in the mid nineteenth century, and full of rich characters.

AUTHOR\'S NOTE: This is \""The Beta Version\"" of this podiobook. 7th Son: Descent is now available as a print novel from St. Martin\'s Press. During the editorial process, significant changes and improvements were made to Descent\'s print manuscript. Character names were changed, and events at the end of the print novel were modified in ways that will impact the rest of the print trilogy. The print novel represents an official reboot of the 7th Son series.

Due to these changes, this \""Beta Version\"" of Book One: Descent is no longer the \""official\"" version of the podiobook. Please visit the 7th Son: Descent (The Print Edition) page to subscribe to the definitive version of the story.

THE STORY
Three weeks ago, the U.S. president was murdered by a four-year-old boy.

Today, seven men stare at each other in a locked conference room. Kidnapped and brought to this underground facility, the strangers are sitting in silence, thunderstruck. Despite minor physical differences, they all appear to be the same man, with the same name ... and the same childhood memories.

Unwitting participants in a secret human cloning experiment, these seven \""John Michael Smiths\"" have been gathered by their creators for one reason -- to capture the mastermind behind the president\'s assassination.

Their target? The man they were cloned from; the original John Michael Smith, code-named John Alpha.

Soon our heroes -- John, Jack, Michael, Kilroy2.0 and the others -- realize the president\'s murder was merely a prologue to Alpha\'s plans. As the mystery deepens and the implications of Alpha\'s scheme are slowly revealed, the clones decide to stand against John Alpha. The outcome will unearth a conspiracy larger than they could have ever imagined.

Voices: New Media Fiction brings together the pioneer short fiction podcasters. Experimenting from putting short-short fiction to novellas over their podcasts, these writers were the first to test the new medium for storytelling. Some wrote specifically for podcasts, some read previously published fiction, and some read entirely new stories. Some listeners asked if they could get just the stories in audio form, and that request brought about this podiobook. Cory Doctorow tells us a story about a post-apocalyptic government run by sysadmins and James Patrick Kelly narrates a story of a strange reconciliation. We've collected 18 stories for you, the first short fiction to go out over podcast, and look forward to bringing you more.

"58","The Curious Education Of Epitome Quirkstandard","2006-03-08 13:11:30","1","0","This peculiar comic novel concerns two men and a woman and looks at how they came to be where they were when they met and the effect that meeting had upon them. 

	One man is Epitome Quirkstandard, a benighted aristocrat in the Wodehousian tradition whose staff have abandoned him to go and fight in the First World War and who discovers the taste for learning - especially when he attempts to make his own breakfast. 

	The other man is Mr. Crepuscular, a man who has written a multitude of educative pamphlets that he kindly rents out to Quirkstandard. As an illiterate scamp he ran away to join the circus, but through a series of unlikely adventures he ends up as a wise quasi-Buddhist who understands that sometimes the circus just isn't the right place to be.

	And the woman is Quirkstandard's aunt, Penelope Penultimate, a beautiful but severe lady of mature years who spent the majority of her life abroad taking parties of teenage girls on adventure holidays, with no insurance.

	The story comes to a head when she issues an invitation to the men to come to her cottage in the country for the weekend. When they do so all manner of storylines come together, leading to unexpected revelations, arguments, jealousies, tensions, parlour games, picnics and nudity. Oh, it's so exciting.

	Along the way the book is filled with historical and biographical asides as it covers the broad sweep of life from the sawdust circuses of the 1860s, through the Amazon Basin of the 1890s, right up to the ultra-modern trench-warfare of the 1910s. It is discursive and meandering in a way that makes it a particularly diminutive descendant of Tristram Shandy or Three Men In A Boat or something akin to Douglas Adams without the science-fiction. Some people like this sort of thing.

	The author, A.F. Harrold, is a prize-winning performance poet, comedian and Englishman.  More can be discovered at <a href=""http://www.afharrold.co.uk"">

Aer\'La only wants to be free...

The Confederated Worlds are unparalleled as a society of free people, yet, somehow, slavery still manages to exist. Aer\'La, a non-human, was bred to serve as a pleasure slave. Years ago, she escaped her masters and masqueraded as a human, joining the Confederate Navy, where she worked her way up to ship\'s Bos\'n under the heroic Captain Jan Atal.  Now, Aer\'La\'s secret has been discovered by Atal\'s superiors, the media, and the world at large. Branded a sociopath, she learns that even a free society isn\'t willing to grant freedom - or justice - to all.

Library Journal says: <i>\""The author of the Arbiter Chronicles, an award-winning audio drama, vividly brings to life a cast of compelling characters while telling a story that measures the cost of freedom.

<b>To End A War</b>

To End A WarNearly a thousand years ago a great warrior named Lachlan sought to unify his people, using the power of the Three Swords of Destiny.  Before his victory, Lachlan was killed by his trusted friend, Allarun.  Now, Allarun is still in power but haunted by dreams of Lachlan\'s death curse: that Lachlan would return to avenge his death.  Allarun\'s decision is to destroy the very people Lachlan tried to unite. Only two men have the power to stop the slaughter.  Romarin, the last of a line of kings, and a half-blood mercenary named Shadowhelm.  One may be destined to be Lachlan, but can they unlock the secret to Lachlan\'s power before Allarun kills them?  \""Prophecy Of Swords is a remarkably rich fantasy that takes you into new realms of wonder and imagination.  The battles and magic portrayed here full of excitement and intrigue.  It\'s hard to find a good fantasy that isn\'t a rehash of all that has been done before, but Margaret H.

"79","An Irregular Miscellany: A selection of essays and lectures from the Common University","2006-05-30 20:17:27","1","0","Throughout the 1920s the Common University provided a free and ready source of education to the working classes of England through various lecture series and the distribution of educative pamphlets in the East End. At the time it renowned as a philanthropic exercise noted more for its good intentions than its practice of asking for lecturers' credentials. In the mid 1930s it shut down amid a small furore over the nonsense it was teaching. It was assumed by all involved that that would be the end of it.

Then, toward the end of the 1990s the English poet A.F. Harrold discovered a box of papers in the attic of an elderly stranger. After exhaustive investigations, leads followed and clues uncovered he discovered that what he held in his hands were lecture notes, reports of speeches, lessons and seminars from the Common University long thought lost by educational historians. ""Gosh,"" he thought, ""This stuff's jolly interesting.""

Looking into the history of the Common University he found that the lives of those involved in it were surprisingly exciting and he dramatised those events and those intrepid people in a series of novels that begin with The Curious Education of Epitome Quirkstandard.  Now, however, he has decided to share some of the original documents that lead him to stories through an irregular series of readings. He's right, it is jolly interesting.

"74","Flores Girl: The Children God Forgot","2006-05-25 17:30:59","1","0","There is something in the jungle of Irma Flores that has terrorized Sarah for years.  As a scientist she needs to know what it is and by confronting this evil she is about to be awakened from her nightmare. She doesn’t know it but she will also begin her first faltering steps toward enlightenment.  Along the way, she will have to contend with a strange dwarf people, pirates, corporate raiders and an obstinate lover.  Her road to nirvana will be a raw and bruising journey that is certain to be both entertaining and moving for the listener.

The media eagerly made the startling announcement about the unique hobbit fossil find and the existence of hobbit human relatives on Flores Island 16,000 years ago, prehistoric survivors that seemingly went extinct just a few short years ago.  Only, the scientists were dead wrong! They are still alive today and two American scientists are going to discover them and unwittingly they will introduce this tribe of small, archaic people to the ultimate modern predator: humanity.

These three-foot tall bipeds are not the Hobbits of the JRR Tolkien\'s stories, but a small tribe of dwarf prehistoric people, Homo Floresiensis, living in seeming isolation for nearly a half million years on the Indonesian tropical island of Irma Flores.  In their unrelenting quest for knowledge, Sarah and Richard inadvertently expose these innocents to the onslaught of the modern world including corporate raiders, Indonesian pirates and ardent religious zealots. In the process of discovery and befriending these ancient people, Sarah and Richard must survive a serious clash of divergent personalities while rediscovering their own humanity and need for love. This is their adventure, combining a clash of cultures, religious ardor with the oldest stories of all: the meaning of friendship and true love.

This as a rousing, humorous adventure novel with serious undertones about our very definition of humanity, and how we treat the other sentient creatures that share our small planet.  Many elements within the novel have a strong connection with the topical issues of today ranging from Creationism, the environment, stem cell research and finally to the voracious appetite of our ever expanding consumer economy.  Moreover, the so-called Hobbit people described within the novel, locally known by Flores natives as the Ebu Gogo, are being searched for by scientists in Indonesia as we speak.  This story is so gripping that both \""Sixty Minutes\"" on CBS and National Geographic ran numerous specials on the controversial Flores Island fossil find.

The Children God Forgot is the first novel in the Flores Girl Trilogy and the second novel is nearing completion!

The future story of United States Internment Camps ... of the dreams of the pre-deceased ... and of triumph beyond oblivion.

Searching for his gay son, Jon, media mogul Michael Barris smuggles himself into one of centers only to discover that it and the other centers are actually extermination camps. With a strange assortment of allies, including the leader of the camp\'s gay barracks, an army officer and a local cowboy, Barris precipitates an inmates\' rebellion that promises the unraveling of the death-camp system and the overthrow of the government that established it.

The fields are flooded, the bridges crumble and the increasingly isolated town is host to a serial killer with a grudge against the wealthy Lollo family. Slipping between a small cast of characters; the killer, the tortured policeman hiding a dark secret, the returning son, the inquisitive librarian, the boy caught between cultures.... each of these marred, struggling humans a part of the threadbare fabric of the town. Throughout the story, secrets and motivations are slowly revealed, people continue to die, and it continues to rain. - 

<i><a href=\""http://podpeep.blogspot.com/\"">Emily from POD People</a></i>

The story is about a Native American, driven to madness by his experience growing up in the small upstate New York town of Canyon Park being discriminated, molested and ostracized. In his mind, various characters of his tribe\'s mythology and American popular culture vie for his soul. He terrorizes the residents of Canyon Park, murdering those he judges guilty, to punish them for their crimes against him and his ancestors. Strangely, since the killing spree began, there has been a deluge of constant rain adding to the dismal mood and hampering efforts to stop him while the resident also battle nature\'s fury. Under these conditions, various characters gather from places as close as the local library, to as far away as New York City, to absolve their sins and stop their beloved town from being eroded away.

All the characters are eventually stripped bare in this trying time and face their naked souls, their dark inner parts that they are afraid to see and their true selves. America\'s national guilt over the destruction of the Native American culture is weaved through the motivation of the characters as they struggle with the consequences of acts they committed in the past or the acts of their kin.

The Indian Boarding Schools and the Mythology of Iroquois Creation Myth were thoroughly researched and are based on fact though the setting and characters are all fictional.

Toshi never expected the strange visitor who one evening stepped foot inside
his master's shop. A samurai smelling of the sea, dripping on the ground,
algae strung from his armor. For the first time in his life, he discovers
that monsters do roam the earth. And this one has been specifically looking

Dragged from his home and all he has ever known, Toshi must now use his

Yet at every turn there are problems. There are even those seeking to

Corrupt business owners, unscrupulous local politicians, impossible odds and a highly unconventional student body are just a few of the obstacles faced by Lawrence R. Velvel, as he packs up his home of 16 years and heads north to become Dean of a brand new law school in Lowell, Massachusetts.   When nothing in Lowell turns out to be what it first appears, Velvel and a handful of law students are forced to choose between giving up on their life long dream, and attempting the impossible.

AUTHOR\'S NOTE: This is \""The Beta Version\"" of this podiobook. 7th Son: Descent is now available as a print novel from St. Martin\'s Press. During the editorial process, significant changes and improvements were made to Descent\'s print manuscript. Character names were changed, and events at the end of the print novel were modified in ways that will impact the rest of the print trilogy. The print novel represents an official reboot of the 7th Son series.

Due to these changes, this \""Beta Version\"" of Book Two: Deceit is no longer the \""official\"" version of the podiobook. Please visit the 7th Son: Descent (The Print Edition) page to subscribe to the definitive beginning of the trilogy. You\'re welcome to continue the series with this version of Deceit, but understand that you will encounter slight inconsistencies in character names and plot references.

THE STORY
Two days ago, seven human clones -- John, Michael, Father Thomas, Dr. Mike, Jonathan, Jack and Kilroy2.0 -- were torn away from their \""normal\"" lives to stop a ruthless plot created by their progenitor, a man code-named John Alpha. Their quest was a descent into conspiracy, violence and death.

The clones were successful in their mission, but victory was not without its price.

As 7th Son: Book Two - Deceit begins, the Beta clones are demoralized, reeling from their loss ... and about to learn that John Alpha\'s plans are far from over.

To prevent the next phase of Alpha\'s plan, John, Kilroy2.0, and the others must unearth more dark secrets about the government project from which they were spawned. They will experience the horrors of betrayal, and race cross-country to track John Alpha.

And they will finally realize the scope of Alpha\'s wrath -- the bloodshed the clones have witnessed is merely a prelude to the world-rending destruction to come. Unless they can stop it first.

"105","All Sorts of People - Ordered Complexity","2006-10-12 23:59:12","1","0","\'All Sorts of People - Ordered Complexity\' is a collection of seven linked books:

Book One presents personality differences - we may describe you, your family, your friends, in a great deal of detail. We develop symmetries between the various forms of thought. This will help us later as we map things onto the human brain.

Book Two examines the energy engine of the mind, the source of our excitement. This form of thought operates strongly in one personality style and gives it \'charisma.\' We\'ll look at multiple historical persons, using direct quotes chained together from published historical biographies. That way you know we aren\'t making this up.

Book Three analyzes typical compatibilities and conflicts, and uses this information, with the symmetries developed previously, to generate a static model of the human mind. Surprisingly, there turn out to be only about eight common marriage combinations.

Book 4 looks at a second personality style - it\'s the basis for sensitivity, and thus for human interaction and love. We examine its development, in persons from history, again using only direct quotes from historical biographies.

Books 5, 6 and 7 are too sensitive to put on to audio. Thus, we leave them for you to read by yourself - they can be downloaded from our website at www.cognitivestyles.com.

These seven books, taken together, provide a possible explanation for human consciousness - this is the Holy Grail of the social sciences. We leave it for you to judge how well we succeed.

In a hardboiled dystopian future, one major American city has been divided in two. Separated by much more than a river, one side is an unfinished technological marvel populated by mega-skyscrapers where the wealthy live, work, and play. The other is a forsaken wasteland where order is strictly maintained by a rogue group of cleric soldiers known as the street preachers. But this dichotomy is about to change. Slowly, quietly, clandestine forces are working to undermine the small piece of redemption the street preachers have brought to their concrete flocks. In the face of watching their second chance crumble to dust, some will fight to stop it. Others will kill to make it happen.

A bold experiment in podcast fiction, The Failed Cities Monologues are told from the shifting perspectives of the characters who inhabit this world, twisted noir archetypes and cyberpunk warriors.

But the girl turns out to belong to the chief Maoist -- and he turns out to harbor alarming aspirations in the field of revolutionary terror. And so Fenton, wearing a forcibly grown beard, finds himself propelled into a bizarre covert world of death lists, backyard bomb labs, untraceable handguns, and attempted wet jobs of wildly varying quality -- a world in which he must choose between losing the girl forever or else participating, perhaps very soon, in a successful terrorist atrocity.

Set in about 1891 in Holloway, which was then a typical suburb of the impecuniously respectable kind, the authors contrive a record of the manners, customs and experiences of the late Victorian era. The bare record of facts, simply recorded, manages to be humorous rather than dull, no doubt because of the usual occupations of the authors.

It\'s a largely character-driven story; the people and their various shifting relationships compel the plot forward through sometimes subtle, sometimes brutal plot twists towards the final, nail-gnawing climax.","MIke Bennett","http://mikebennettpodcast.com","http://media.podiobooks.com/pbpromos/PB-Sleepless-Promo.mp3","18928","sleepless.jpg","0","7","0","one-among-the-sleepless","0","1","http://www.podiobooks.com/blog/2006/12/05/one-among-the-sleepless/",,"0954146301",,,,,"0","1","4.89032","4.89103","4.76923","4.83974","by-nc-nd","Literature",,,

Daniel Feldman was a doctor once.  He made the mistake of saving a friend\'s life in violation of Medical Lobby rules.  Now, he\'s a pariah, shunned by all, forbidden to touch another patient.

But things are more loose on Mars. There, Doc Feldman is welcomed by the colonists, even as he\'s hunted by the authorities.  But, when he discovers a Martian plague may soon wipe out humanity on two planets, the authorities begin hunting him for a different reason altogether.

When nothing in Lowell turns out to be what it first appears, Velvel and a handful of law students are forced to choose between giving up on their life long dream, and attempting the impossible. 
 
This page turning story of the little law school that did is a classic David and Goliath tale, pitting the working class taxi drivers, bank tellers and contractors with the dream of creating a better life for themselves, against wealthy business men, former US Senators, even The American Bar Association.  It is a tale of the everyman overcoming adversity and achieving the impossible. It is a true story.

\""The Best Laid Plans\"" is a satirical novel of Canadian politics written by Terry Fallis.

Driven by a federal election and the life of the resulting minority conservative government, the novel moves between the small town of Cumberland, Ontario on the shores of the Ottawa River, and the nation\'s capital. While the characters and their exploits are often comical, serious ideas on politics and democracy underlie the fun.

Perry Daswey is 6-foot-5, 265 pounds of angry ex-linebacker. He knows all too well that if he doesn\'t control his quick temper, people get hurt. Through constant focus, he has locked his violent past away in the deep dungeons of his mind.

Strange, microscopic parasites tap into Perry\'s bloodstream like tiny little vampires. They start as bright orange blisters, but soon take the shape of triangular growths just beneath his skin.

As Perry begins a desperate battle to cut the Triangles out of his body before it\'s too late, his self-control dissolves into raging, murderous madness.

\""Forensic detective Phil D\'Amato is one of my favorite characters, and the puzzles he solves are always imaginative, ingenious, and addictive, but Paul Levinson really outdoes himself this time in a mystery involving murders, moths, mummies, the Silk Road, poisons, fireflies, and forensics, all woven into a mystery only D\'Amato could solve!

\""At last we get Paul Levinson\'s superb forensic sleuth, Phil D\'Amato, in full-length novel. . . . Kick back and enjoy a mystery that spans the ages.\""
—Jack McDevitt

\""The Silk Code is an intriguing story refreshingly rich not only in action but in ideas.\""
—Stanly Schmidt, editor of Analog

[An] odd and thrilling mix of forensic detective work, intellectual history, and biological speculation. It\'s a rare thriller that actually achieves its goals both as a detective tale and work of boldly speculative SF.
—Locus

As a genre- bending blend of police procedural and science fiction, The Silk Code delivers on its promises...

Jenneva and Egam believe they have found a Junction and plan a trip with Alexander to test the theory and investigate the origins of the elves and dwarves. Because they believe that the perennial animosity between the two races is due to misunderstandings about their histories, the mages include the prince of elves and the prince of dwarves in the group. Trouble begins at the very start of the journey as Egam falters going through the Junction, awakening an old nemesis, the evil demon, Alutar. It appears that the excursion will not just clarify history, but actually change it. As the group discovers they are trapped in the new Universe, the shocking truth of the real history of the races is overshadowed by impending doom as an ancient prophecy begins to unfold. Meanwhile, the evil sorcerer, Sarac, not only gains freedom from his imprisonment, but also gains the blessing of the evil demon, Alutar. With the blessing, Sarac is given new powers and is promised a reign of a thousand years. The race is on to prevent Sarac from unfettered control of the Universes, as our trio stands incapable of altering the prophecy of destruction.

They practice an animistic religion which invests godlike qualities in animals such as the fox and the bear, and in certain features of the landscape. They believe that the sun (male) and the earth (female) mated to make a son, who then found a bride and fathered human beings.  The earth and sun share our daily experience of living, as do all plant and animal creatures. 

This form of dynamic interdependence has been expressed over time in a wealth of songs and stories told by Sami shamans and wizards.  The stories are characterized by great reverence for our natural environment, which can form a strong spiritual foundation for sustainable living.  A selection of these stories is now for the first time adapted into modern English verse, written and voiced by Jabez L. Van Cleef.

Jabez L. Van Cleef, who also wrote \""All Is Beautiful:  The Navajo Creation Story\"" for Podiobooks.com, has written poetic versions of spiritual texts from all of the world\'s great religious traditions.

When the conflict focuses on a small town in West Virginia, Ken Murphy, Iraq veteran and Lieutenant Colonel in the West Virginia National Guard, must find a way to protect his family and community in a world turned upside down. In a future America terrifying to behold, Republic evokes the specter of civil war in a world that is simultaneously familiar and changed beyond recognition.

Republic is written and performed by Charles Sheehan-Miles (also author of Prayer at Rumayla: A Novel of the Gulf War) with music produced by Luke Tripp.

The Podler Book Review, June 7, 2007
... vital, gripping, convincing ... compelling enough you fear you\'re doing something subversive simply by reading ... an engrossing read....

These stygian corners of existence are where reality is stretched thin and something hungry is waiting just outside the corner of your eye.

Turn out the lights, take a deep breath, and dare to visit one of these places.

Crescent is dark science fiction at it\'s most visceral.  Phil Rossi weaves a tale that is reminiscent of old school Stephen King but with a shiny, new set of tricks and an appetite to terrify.   There\'s sex. There\'s corruption. There\'s horror.  And after you sweat your way through the first chapter, there\'s plenty more to keep you awake at night.

Crescent features an original soundtrack written and performed by the author.

"191","Axiom-man","2007-07-03 18:56:53","1","0","One night Gabriel Garrison was visited by a nameless messenger who bestowed upon him great power, a power intended for good. Once discovering what this power was and what it enabled him to do, Gabriel became Axiom-man, a symbol of hope in a city that had none.

One night after a routine patrol, a mysterious black cloud appears over the city. Flying over to investigate it, Axiom-man is stopped short when the cloud\'s presence shakes him to the core. An electrifying fear emanates from the cloud and he can barely get near it. Quickly, the cloud takes flight and leads him on a wild goose chase throughout the city, only to flee from him in the end. Almost immediately after the cloud\'s appearance, a new hero arises, Redsaw, clad in a black cape and cowl. The people, now enamored with this new super-powered marvel, seem to have forgotten about Axiom-man and all he\'s done for them.

Except something\'s wrong. That same fear that emanated from the cloud drips off Redsaw like a foul smell and Axiom-man can barely get close to him without feeling ill.

What is Redsaw\'s agenda and who is he? And why is it every time Axiom-man gets close to him it feels as if his powers are being sucked away?

As if that wasn\'t enough, Gabriel\'s day job hasn\'t gotten any easier. His co-worker and the woman he adores, Valerie Vaughan, has little interest in him, and his boss has made it clear that one more day late to work will be the day he cleans out his desk. Then there\'s the new trainee, Gene Nemek. What is his fascination with Redsaw and why is he never around when Redsaw appears?

From flying over city streets and soaring at dizzying heights, to balancing a secret identity with destiny, Axiom-man must discover what Redsaw\'s presence means and how it ties into the messenger\'s life-altering visit before the city—and the world—are enamored with an evil that has haunted the cosmos since the dawn of Time.

\""Axiom-man is that unique breed of superhero that seems almost lost
amid today\'s gaggle of the dark and tormented. He\'s nice, he cares,
and his strength comes not from his fantastic powers, but from his
soul. A.P. Fuchs has written a defining superhero novel.\""

During the editorial process, significant changes and improvements were made to Descent\'s print manuscript. Character names were changed, and events at the end of the print novel were modified in ways that will impact the rest of the print trilogy. The print novel represents an official reboot of the 7th Son series.

Please visit the 7th Son: Descent (The Print Edition) page to subscribe to the definitive beginning of the trilogy. You\'re welcome to continue the series with this version of Destruction, but note that you will encounter slight inconsistencies in character names and plot references.

THE STORY
As day four in the 7th Son adventure begins, John Alpha\'s quest for anarchy and genocide enters its final stage.

At every turn, the global terrorist has been triumphant. The world is reeling from a nuclear attack. An unprecedented energy crisis is upon us. Alpha himself has exclusive access to the White House, and secret weapons primed to propel his conspiracy into the endgame. The goal: planetary chaos.

Amidst this turmoil, the 7th Son\'s four surviving Beta Clones -- John, Father Thomas, Kilroy2.0 and Jack -- must defy their creators and hunt Alpha on their terms. Their mission: to stop the greatest assassination plot in history. The secrets John and his brothers discover will press them toward a final battle with their progenitor ... a battle in which the clones are outgunned, outnumbered and out of time.

Alliances will be made. Heroes will die. The end is nigh.

Though they follow the conventions of traditional tales, they have more humor than the Brothers Grimm, fewer princesses than Disney, and a lot less gore than Angela Carter. Wrightales take on eternal conundrums like: how to avoid ending up in the middle of nowhere, discovering the Secret to Happiness, and the search for a life that doesn’t involve goats.

            They take a whimsical, once-upon-a-time view of life’s quandaries and travails. The search for happiness and fulfillment is explored with humor and imagination.

"202","Grey","2007-08-03 02:26:22","1","0","High fashion, corporate malfeasance, celebrity culture, and an obsessed media collide with exuberant violence and volatile intensity in Grey, the explosive debut novel by Jon Armstrong.

For Michael Rivers, life is perfect. Michael has everything; tall, handsome, and famous, he is worshipped by billions of fans around the globe. He is wealthy beyond measure, the heir apparent to RiverGroup, one of the handful of high-tech corporations that controls the world. He is fashionable, setting trends with his wardrobe of immaculate designer suits, each a unique and celebrated work of art. And Michael is in love, perfect love, sharing a private language based entirely on quotes from the latest fashion magazine advertisements, with Nora, his beautiful, witty, and equally perfect fiance, the only woman with whom he can see surgically-altered monochromatic eye to eye.

When an assassin\'s bullets pierce Michael\'s body before the unblinking eyes of cameras, reporters, and viewers at a press junket, everything changes, forcing Michael to question everything about his previously perfect world. Illusions shattered and forcibly separated from Nora, Michael seeks to uncover the reasons behind the attempted assassination, embarking on a quest that leads him to question his relationships with his loud, profane, and narcissistically Ultra father; his estranged mother; and the perilous, contaminated, neo-feudalistic world that lies beyond the safe and protected bubble of corporate family life.

Michael must delve deep into his past, finding that all paths he uncovers seem to lead to the now-closed PartyHaus, and to a time when he was the golden boy, dancing furiously to the beat of notorious all-night Rage parties thrown by his father.

Grey was published by NightShade Books in February 2007.

1999

Aston Somerfield, casual smoker and part-time alcoholic, has come to London to find himself. He knows who he\'s looking for, he\'s seen him on the cover of the NME. Drawn across oceans by fame and fate, Aston is keeping his diary empty to make sure he\'s available. Won\'t commit to anything until it\'s everything.

London, however, has other ideas.

When a virtual stranger calls Aston a few hours before his death, fate catches up with him, derailing his barely-made plans. Amid a hundred boozy evenings and romantic deadends, a mystery unfurls.

Equally assisted and hindered by tremulous accountant Tom Hensley and dedicated loafer Steven Black, Aston uncovers a different London, one of murder, ghosts, dangerous emails and the second big bang.

As chaotic and random as the city it inhabits, Electricity gradually evolves into a mystery bigger than the universe itself. Being of a somewhat useless persuasion, Aston does his best to ignore it.

Rumi threads together here entertaining stories with his mystical Sufi teachings, and passionate lyrical flights.

Book One provides the overall picture of the map, beginning with the reed torn from its reed-bed, and concluding with Ali\'s return above. Incredibly, Rumi achieves all of this using the simplest Persian language, everyday imagery and well-established stories, albeit with his own startling twists and innovations. No wonder he has even become the best-selling poet in the English language in the last decade.

Rumi\'s poetry is celebrated for its musicality. This translation, the Oxford World\'s Classics edition of which was awarded the 2004 Lois Roth Prize, follows the Persian original by using rhyming couplets. Toure Moumouni and Alain Kersanty perform Rumi\'s favourite musical instruments, the ney, the robab, the tar, and the daf, to give you a complete and authentic listening experience.

Yet sixty years later, the world still suffers from war, greed and madness. Worse, man\'s nadir of systematic cruelty returns with bizarre new weapons. The metahumans of Earth must find a way to defeat this powerful foe and discover what lurks behind the scenes - a secret world hidden from our own. Mercedes Lackey, one of fantasy\'s most beloved voices, and new talent Steve Libbey bring you a podcast series that catapults the classic superhero into the 21st century.

Book One: Invasion starts the series off with a bang - a set of coordinated attacks by Nazi warriors in futuristic battle armor. We meet our cast of heroes in the midst of chaos: Belladonna Blue, a young azure-skinned healer; Victoria Victrix Nagy, a geomancer fighting panic attacks; Handsome Devil, whose luck is metahumanly good; Red Saviour, strident leader of an anachronistic Soviet team; Red Djinni, the shapeshifting criminal; and John Murdock, a fugitive super-soldier. Watching over them all is the Seraphym, descended from the Infinite to protect humanity.

As the heroes fend off the blitzkrieg attack, they are left wondering what secrets have erupted from this hidden world, and whether, once unleashed, they can be contained. For there are clues that all is not what it seems...

Mercedes Lackey says: \""Steve Libbey gives the \'sword-and-sandal\' epic a kick in the tunic and  propels it into the gestalt of the 21st century, with an everyman hero whose brains triumph over brawn.\""

Crixus Oraan is a water artesan, an engineer who builds aqueducts and piping for bathhouses and mansions in the empire of Rond (which bears a resemblance to our own Roman Empire). His guild has entrusted him with a large sum of gold to establish a branch in the up-and-coming coastal town of Restia. In a misguided effort to win enough gold to buy a lavish house for his new fiancé Kharrina, he loses the guild\'s gold in a card game.

A shady sea captain present at the game—and possibly responsible for fleecing him—offers to sneak him off to the wild and mysterious continent of Minq. Afraid to lose his status in society for his crime, he agrees, hoping to gain back the gold he lost and compensate the guild back in Rond.

In this first volume in the bold new Aqua Pura Trilogy, Crixus finds employment with the Lamiae of Nistru, a cruel society where those at the top bathe in the lifeblood of those on the bottom. Will his conscience allow him to finish the job?

By turns dark, comedic, erotic and thrilling, The Bloodbaths is a book that transcends genre to stand on its own.

It\'s the story of Isaac, seemingly just a time-server in the system (he works \""at a mid-level position for a mid-sized company in midtown Manhattan\"") whose programming is wiped clean as the result of a series of  \""big dreams\"" during which he loses all fear of death.

Filled with light, feeling invincible, Isaac encounters a woman similarly determined to erase her past who eagerly takes a new name for herself: Georgia. Together they enter a shamanic realm where limitations of time and space no longer apply and where the real forces behind the trashing of the planet soon reveal themselves.

MUST NOT SLEEP answers these questions: Who or what is encouraging environmental meltdown and a state of perpetual war? Why does the current American administration engage in actions seeming to sabotage our future?  When Isaac realizes that something more than human greed must explain what\'s going on, another order of reality opens up. The demonic possession of our leading political figures shows itself in ways he and Georgia are barely able to withstand. But all is not lost: learning to use their innate powers, they are able to heal both themselves and the darkest figure of the present moment, \""the man with the frozen heart.\""

No sooner does she arrive than the saint, dead for seventeen centuries, starts talking to her--out loud. The voice is hard enough for Clio to take; her mother, in her final illness, had lost touch with reality, and Clio fears the same fate. When the saint drags her unwilling into the past, to live the lives of people long dead, Clio fights to hold on to her reason. At the same time, in \""ordinary\"" life, she starts to define--and have defined for her--a place in the life of the town. The resident mystic takes a liking to her; when she dies, she leaves everything to Clio. The sexton of the cathedral becomes a malevolent presence who threatens Clio at unforseen intervals. She falls in love with an Anglican priest on the cathedral staff, who is jealous of the very mystical experiences Clio struggles to deny.

When the the past itself comes to life in Clio\'s present, in the person of a medieval plague victim who appears in her living room, Clio must choose between her rationalism and her compassion for the dying young man. Her decision lands her in a mental hospital, where she has to confront both the fear of losing her reason and the reality of her experiences.

When Clio gains her release from the psychiatric ward, her psychiatrist, like many others, asks her to pray for him. As she re-enters the community, she finds that other people, whom she doesn\'t even know, have been taking care of the cottage left her by the mystic. When her employer is injured in an auto accident, Clio\'s half-believed prayers seem to lead to a miraculous healing.

Throughout the story, past and present are shuffled like two halves of the same deck of cards. With each descent into history, Clio learns about other lives. With each return to the present, she has to make sense of her own life in light of what she\'s learned.

THE COMMUNION OF THE SAINT (the title is a paraphrase of a line from the Apostle\'s Creed) is a novel of past and present, skepticism and belief.

The story question: how does a modern, skeptical, rational person fit the irrational, the supernatural, into her life and still make some kind of sense of it all?

But on the last day of classes and dreaming about a gorgeous gal, he woke up in a white washed world with nothing there! ... That included his clothes (oops). He found himself on the other side of the mirrors and could look out of any mirror. With a few false starts (didn\'t that woman ever hear of someone asking for directions), he got himself out and back into the real world and his own home ... He then wished he stayed put.

A wizard from a race of humanoid toads wanted Vern to come to his world to aid in defending the toads from two different races. Vern\'s talents were hidden - he was a special bachelor (did that mean \""easy to get rid of\""?). He would be a powerful though inexperienced wizard in the other world. \""Please come, the situation is desperate\"", pleaded the toad. Vern, of course, refused. Then after some persuading (and turning Vern\'s world even more upside down), Vern said he\'d think about it.

Sunday morning, Vern found himself in another world. \""I said I\'d THINK about it!\"" snapped Vern. But he was now committed. After meeting a few individuals who wanted to slice, dice, or otherwise harm him, Vern got into the quest. Then he met a beautiful Red unicorn stallion with magical powers.

Suppose al-Qaeda had a second, potentially more devastating attack planned in 2001. How would it be thwarted? 

\""The Onion Files\"" is a spy thriller differing from all previous novels in one very important aspect: author Val Pattee was one of the Western world\'s top spy masters. Serving as chief of intelligence for NATO in Europe during periods of Cold War-era terrorism, he worked with the heads of intelligence for sixteen member nations, and conferred with his Soviet and Red Chinese counterparts.

Although \""The Onion Files\"" is fiction, Pattee infuses the action with a realism of people and places only an insider could deliver. The title refers to an ingenious and diabolical plot by al&#8209;Qaeda to devastate vast areas of the United States soon after the 9/11 attacks. Pattee introduces readers to protagonists Jim and Mark Buchan, who work with the US Central Intelligence Agency and Russian counter-terrorism units in a fast-paced hunt across three continents to halt a computer virus and its brilliant creator.","Val Pattee","http://www.valpattee.com","http://media.podiobooks.com/pbpromos/Promo-TheOnionFiles-01.mp3","34815","TheOnionFiles.jpg","1","5","0","the-onion-files","0","1","http://www.podiobooks.com/blog/2008/02/27/the-onion-files/",,"1897435053",,,,,"0","0","3.94444","3.16667","4.22222","3.94444","by-nc-nd","Literature",NULL,NULL,NULL

"255","Infected","2008-02-29 15:32:53","1","0","Across America a mysterious disease is turning ordinary people into raving, paranoid murderers who inflict brutal horrors on strangers, themselves, and even their own families.

Working under the government\'s shroud of secrecy, CIA operative Dew Phillips crisscrosses the country trying in vain to capture a live victim. With only decomposing corpses for clues, CDC epidemiologist Margaret Montoya races to analyze the science behind this deadly contagion. She discovers that these killers all have one thing in common - they\'ve been contaminated by a bioengineered parasite, shaped by a complexity far beyond the limits of known science.

Meanwhile Perry Dawsey - a hulking former football star now resigned to life as a cubicle-bound desk jockey - awakens one morning to find several mysterious welts growing on his body. Soon Perry finds himself acting and thinking strangely, hearing voices . . . he is infected.

The fate of the human race may well depend on the bloody war Perry must wage with his own body, because the parasites want something from him, something that goes beyond mere murder.

Infected is the first major print release from Internet phenom Scott Sigler, whose podcast-only audiobooks have drawn an immense cult following, with more than three million individual episodes downloaded. Now Sigler storms the bookstore shelves with this cinematic, relentlessly paced novel that mixes and matches genres, combining horror, technothriller, and suspense in a heady mix that is equal parts Chuck Palahniuk, Michael Crichton, and Stephen King.

Infected will crawl beneath your skin and leave fresh blood on every page.

QUOTES: 
\""Part Stephen King, part Chuck Palahniuk, Infected blends science fiction and horror into a pulpy masterpiece of action, terror, and suspense.  Three recommendations: don\'t read it at night, or just after you\'ve eaten a full meal, or if you\'re weak of heart.  You\'ve been warned!\""
--James Rollins, New York Times bestselling author of The Judas Strain and Black Order

\""Sigler is masterful at grabbing the reader by the throat and refusing to let go. Just when I thought I knew what abyss he was leading me across, he knocked the bridge out from under... I think I screamed the whole way down... Infected is a marvel of gonzo, in-your-face, up-to-the-minute terror.\""
--Lincoln Child, New York Times bestselling author of Deep Storm and Death Match

\""Sigler is the Richard Matheson of the 21st Century...smart and creepy, Infected is a flawless thinking-person\'s thriller. Bravo to a bold new talent!\""
--Jonathan Maberry, Bram Stoker Award-winning author of Bad Moon Rising and Ghost Road Blues

\""Horror mavens rejoice! Infected is a revelation -- a novel that lives up to its hype. From page one, the story of a mysterious smart-virus that turns its hosts into deadly drooling drones creeps up on a reader like the ratchet of a roller coaster climbing toward its inevitable crest. Sigler brings the folksy character detail of Stephen King, the conceptual panache of Clive Barker, and the oozing, shuddery pathologies of a David Cronenberg movie. Zombies, spies, conspiracies, and gallons of goo make this the fastest read in the west! Highest recommendation!\""
-- Jay Bonansinga, national bestselling author of Shattered, Twisted, Frozen, and The Sinking of the Eastland

\""Sigler has a unique talent for keeping readers on the edge of their seats; I absolutely had to know what was going to happen next. Infected is full of mayhem, action, and gore--and you won\'t be able to put it down.\""
-- Dave Wellington, author of 13 Bullets and the Monster Island trilogy

\""Scott Sigler\'s Infected is a bucking pulp pony that throws you this way and that, and just when you think you\'ve got your balance, that ole pony bucks the other way. All in all, one hell of an exhilarating ride, and highly recommended.\""

The Paratime Police had a real headache this time! Tracing one man in a population of millions is easy—compared to finding one gang hiding out on one of billions of probability lines!

This story from 1955 has rocket ships, time travel, slaves, post-hypnotic suggestions, drugged citizens, and a complete disregard for human rights. And those are the good guys. As a look back in time at \""classic\"" science fiction, it\'s an interesting snapshot of a time when tobacco was common, sexism was unconscious, and female characters were a long way from Lara Croft.

From a review on Garageband.com by Nicolas Walls:  \""Well spoken... this is a piece that sounds like it was written in a different time. The voice is clear and punctuated very well. It sounds like an essay from a great thinker. Not sounds like...but is! This is too much information to receive in one sitting. I find my self bogged down in thought. I feel as if I would enjoy decompressing these expressed sentiments and writing an essay of my own based upon what I have interpreted here. It is a lot to absorb even on my second listen. But I am completely intrigued...Excellent work.\""

An excerpt from Part 5:

\""Society, most of whose members
Spend most of their time sated,
Not fully sentient, and bloated
With sense impressions of all kinds,
Awash in sweet irrelevance,
Breathing a vicarious miasma
Of sport, bare skin, soap opera,
Mythology and fantasy,
Will find it hard to resist
The assertions and encroachments
Of those who profit from their torpor,
Creating soft catatonias,
And so controlling their ideas.\""","Jabez L.

"262","The Unstruck Drum of Eternity:  Poetry of Kabir","2008-03-23 17:28:08","1","0","Continuing in the grand tradition of Rumi and Kahlil Gibran, explore the light within your own sensuality in the company of Kabir, the incomparable 15th century poet, weaver, mystic and musician of Benares.

\""Open the window to the west, / In the sky of love, now be lost; / Drink the sweeter honey that steeps / And imbues with heat, the petals / Of the lotus of the heart\'s lips. / Receive the waves in your body: / What splendor is in the warm sea! / Hearken to the sounds of conches / And bells, rising through the branches.\""

The poetry of this 15th century mystic has been recreated in modern English rhymed couplets by Jabez L. Van Cleef, joining the ranks of his poetic interpretations of spiritual texts from all of the world\'s great religious traditions.

Van Cleef\'s voice in dramatic readings explores the fine distinctions between metered prose and music, by creating a spoken word sound environment that lulls the listener into a state of profound receptivity.

In this collection of songs there will be found examples which illustrate nearly every aspect of Kabir\'s thought, and all the fluctuations of the mystic\'s emotion: the ecstasy, the despair, the still beatitude, the eager self-devotion, the flashes of wide illumination, the moments of intimate love. All opposites are reconciled: bondage and liberty, love and renunciation, pleasure and pain. Unity is the one thing that matters to the soul, its destiny and its need; and this union, this discovery of God, is the simplest and most natural of all things, if we would but grasp it. It is brought about by love, not by knowledge or ceremonial observances; and the apprehension which that union confers is ineffable--\""neither This nor That,\"" as the poet has it. The Divine may best be found in the here-and-now: in the normal, human, bodily existence, the \""mud\"" of material life. \""We can reach the goal without crossing the road -- In the home is reality.\"" There love and detachment, bondage and freedom, joy and pain play by turns upon the soul; and it is from their conflict that the Unstruck Music of the Infinite proceeds.","Kabir - Interpreted by Jabez L.

MARS FOR THE MARTIANS!

Dark Kensington had been dead for twenty-five years. It was a fact; everyone knew it. Then suddenly he reappeared, youthful, brilliant, ready to take over the Phoenix, the rebel group that worked to overthrow the tyranny that gripped the settlers on Mars.

The Phoenix had been destroyed not once, not twice, but three times! But this time the resurrected Dark had new plans, plans which involved dangerous experiments in mutation and psionics.

And now the rebels realized they were in double jeopardy. Not only from the government\'s desperate hatred of their movement, but also from the growing possibility that the new breed of mutated monsters would get out of hand and bring terrors never before known to man.

These stories will get your heart racing in thirty minutes or less as you plummet to the depths of human emotion and the desire to protect what is dearest when all hell breaks loose and there is no one there to do anything about it but an Average Joe...or an almost Average Joe.  Think of each episode as something like the Twilight Zone, with guns, knives, and whatever the hero can find to defend themselves and their families from the bad guys.  These are Basil\'s original action novels taken down to single episode bite size chunks that\'ll get your blood pressure up on the commute to the office, or while on the treadmill at the gym. 

From a former Navy Seal, to a dad trying to make things right for his son, to a bunch of twenty something adventurers high on an Alaskan mountain you\'ll get the hardcore action you crave.  Twice a month, delivered right to your MP3 player.

You want action?  You want pulse pounding excitement?  You want to see the bad guys get their due?

"268","The Palimpsest of Human Rights","2008-04-23 00:43:56","1","0","The Palimpsest of Human Rights is an experimental spoken word production which combines verse interpretations of the prose writings of Martin Luther King, Mohandas Gandhi, and Henry Thoreau.  The influence of new, temporally-bound ideas on succeeding generations is revealed in a continuous discourse.

The physical idea of a palimpsest (writing over the top of an existing text in a manuscript) is here extended to an aural experience.  When the texts are read aloud, one over the top of another, the sound preserves some part of the utterance of each original, while concealing some part of the others. Just as the mind of a reader would struggle to decipher what is underneath a superimposed handwriting, the ear of the listener works harder to discern the meaning of the intentionally obscured speech.

The author has adapted prose source materials into a common format by paraphrasing the text into metered lines (iambic pentameter).  In a process called text weaving he creates a long poem in which the successive lines are bound rhythmically, but not always by meaning. In each stanza of the printed book, the first line is from Thoreau, the second line from Gandhi, and the third line from King.","Jabez L.

An antique broker holds the internet in the palm of his hand and learns what really brought the system down.  In the forests of upstate Connecticut, a pair of college students visit the site of legendary hauntings.

Welcome to the Vault.

Phil Rossi, author and twisted mind behind Crescent, brings you a collection of stories that will take you on a terror-fueled ride from the cold abyss of space to your own backyard.  The anthology includes all 7 original Crescent Vignettes, new tales from the Crescent Universe, and many stories in between. 

\""Phil Rossi has taken the podcast novel market by storm. His twisted visions of a Lovecraftian far-future reads like Phillip K. Dick meets David Seltzer. Someone is going make a ton of cash with this guy.\""

"290","Doctor Jack\'s Soapbox Seminars","2008-06-30 09:25:14","1","0","What if the cataclysmic Tunguska explosion of 1908 was caused, not by a meteor or a comet, but by a microscopic black hole?

... Well, like as not, you already know that story -- the one told by Bill DeSmedt in his award-winning novel/podcast <a href=\""http://podiobooks.com/title/singularity\"">Singularity</a>. What you may not know, though, is the story behind the story: the science behind Singularity.

Surprisingly (or maybe not), you can learn a lot about primordial black holes and the Tunguska Event and black hole radiation and the Big Bang on the pages of Singularity. And you don\'t have to take our word for it: some world-class physicists think so too:

\""Bill got the vast majority of the physics right, which is highly unusual -- especially in a book that is such a good read.\""
-- Kip Thorne, Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics, California Institute of Technology and author of Black Holes and Time Warps: Einstein\'s Outrageous Legacy

\""Singularity is an uncommonly good science thriller, quite free of the poetic license some writers take with the laws of nature in order to put together the yarn.\""
-- Jacob D. Bekenstein, Professor of Theoretical Physics, Hebrew University, Jerusalem and discoverer of black-hole entropy

\""As a specialist in black hole astrophysics, I would have to say that this is one of the most creative uses of primordial black-hole theory in science fiction.\""
-- Scott A. Hughes, Professor of Theoretical Astrophysics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Now, for the first time, the real-life counterpart of Singularity\'s resident cosmologist, Doctor Jack Adler, steps up to explain what it is all these scientists are raving about, in his \""Soapbox Seminars\"" -- an informal look at the hard-core science behind the novel.

PS: Doctor Jack\'s got about fifteen or so of these seminars planned out so far, but that\'s subject to change -- and you could change it. If you\'ve got a question about the science behind Singularity, send it to Jack at doctorjack at soapboxseminars.com. Jack will incorporate some of your questions into upcoming Seminars, and the all-time best question will win a hardcover copy of  Singularity, signed by the author, Bill DeSmedt.","John C.

But Mason Phillips---with his cheerful positive outlook, pit bull-like tenacity and an unwillingness to hear the word \'no\'--- has a couple of tricks up his sleeve to keep the ball in his court.

"299","Raven's Gift","2008-07-18 14:23:20","1","0","When Raven comes to Redthwen to meet her mentor Orvannon, she encounters a vicious traveler, a hag with an extraordinary Voice of Command, and that hag\'s charge, a mysterious little girl. By the time Orvannon arrives, Raven will have learned too much about these strangers, and she will have discovered a dragon with the ability to put people into a swoon.

Orvannon\'s instructions start Raven off on an epic adventure. She will master the greatest bit of nose-magic in all of her native Ausland. She will face the dragon in combat. And she will have to deal with the hag while totally under control of that woman\'s power. These adventures lead to more, as Raven discovers how the great city of Shelton is under attack. She must use all her persuasion to bring a powerful wizard to the city\'s aid, and she will find that facing up to the attacking army is not enough.

Raven explores the magical caves created by three great wizards, eventually discovering the greatest evil of her time. Victory in the \""big boss battle\"" is not enough. When the evil magic is destroyed, Raven and her friend must avoid starvation, and face the lightning bolts of yet another mage, to have a chance of staying alive in peace.

Raven\'s Gift is set in a magical, pastoral medieval world. Raven has a strange ability that is as much a curse as a gift. Trouble follows her every step, and danger approaches at every turn. She begins her journey with only her wits and her nose, but though her past haunts her, she finds companions who help her make amends for a terrible mistake.

Raven\'s Gift is a dramatic fantasy with an unusual heroine and intriguing magic. With Raven\'s deep bond to nature and her pragmatic attitude toward the obstacles in her path, she manages to find her place as destiny\'s unsung hero in her dangerous world.

One reader has said that Raven\'s Gift is like South Park mets James Bond meets Dungeons and Dragons. Although there\'s combat and even a military campaign in this novel, much of the action occurs in lively conversations. Even today, at the beginning of the 21st century, it is impossible to imagine making Raven\'s Gift into a movie -- for an unusual reason -- but if such a movie could be made, some parts of it might earn an R rating for being a bit earthy.","Tobias D.

In the course of his adventures, he obtains a stone, whose ultimate meaning is tied up with the fate of a war between two cities. As commonly happens with boys, he finds himself at the center of the conflict. Can he divine the stone’s purpose in time? Even more importantly, can he even hang on  to it?

The story includes a mystery, long journeys, prisons, adventure, and living out-of-doors.  There is also a fairly large battle at the end, with plenty of blood.  Death appears throughout.  I believe that no one washes his hands at any point in the account, but sometimes my memory is faulty. It takes place long ago, but not in a place you\'ll find in an atlas. Some may be disappointed in the absence of wizards and dragons.

Girls are welcome to listen, but they should be forewarned.  Horses are mentioned, but no person develops any meaningful friendship with one.  Talking animals, while interesting, do not figure in any way (unless one considers boys between the ages of ten and fourteen to be talking animals).  There is absolutely no kissing of any kind.

From the very first pages, the author draws you into his struggle with a culture worlds away from his comfort zone.  The author\'s generous and compelling personality allowed him to gain access to the lives of his students and their families, who became characters in his tale.

The author\'s humorous view of China is especially timely and dovetails with the current explosion of interest in that country as it enters the modern world.  The book is neither a travelogue nor a look at the government, although elements of those subjects are woven into the story.  Instead, it is an engaging look at China, tailored toward those who know little about it.

MacKayla Lane\'s life is good. She has great friends, a decent job, and a car that breaks down only every other week or so. In other words, she\'s your perfectly ordinary twenty-first-century woman. Or so she thinks...until something extraordinary happens.

When her sister is murdered, leaving a single clue to her death-a cryptic message on Mac\'s cell phone-Mac journeys to Ireland in search of answers. The quest to find her sister\'s killer draws her into a shadowy realm where nothing is as it seems, where good and evil wear the same treacherously seductive mask. She is soon faced with an even greater challenge: staying alive long enough to learn how to handle a power she had no idea she possessed-a gift that allows her to see beyond the world of man, into the dangerous realm of the Fae....

As Mac delves deeper into the mystery of her sister\'s death, her every move is shadowed by the dark, mysterious Jericho, a man with no past and only mockery for a future. As she begins to close in on the truth, the ruthless Vlane-an alpha Fae who makes sex an addiction for human women-closes in on her. And as the boundary between worlds begins to crumble, Mac\'s true mission becomes clear: find the elusive Sinsar Dubh before someone else claims the all-powerful Dark Book-because whoever gets to it first holds nothing less than complete control of the very fabric of both worlds in their hands....","Karen Marie Moning","http://www.karenmoning.com",,"47175","Darkfever.jpg","1","13","0","darkfever","0","1","http://www.podiobooks.com/blog/2008/08/04/darkfever/",,"0440240980","1423319710",,,,"0","0","4.94444","4.88889","4.75926","4.81482","by-nc-nd","Literature",,,

Those of mixed blood, however, are the victims of bigotry and scorned as inferior in Soldaran society.

Seventeen year old Jelena, of human and elven blood, has spent her entire life as an outcast in Amsara Castle. Her mother, the sister of the Duke of Amsara, died giving birth to her, leaving Jelena to be raised by her foster mother Claudia in the servants\' hall, denied her proper place in the family by her uncle. Though her life is hard, Jelena has managed to adapt to her circumstances. Her fragile peace is shattered when she discovers she has a mysterious and frightening new ability that manifests itself as a powerful blast of blue energy. Convinced the energy is a form of magic inherent in her elven blood, Jelena desperately wants to learn the nature of her ability, and how to control it. She knows the only people who can teach her about elven magic are the elves themselves.

When the Duke announces his intention of selling her as a concubine, Jelena decides to flee Amsara forever. Claudia gives Jelena an extraordinary gift – a clue to her elven father\'s identity in the form of a signet ring. As Jelena\'s mother lay dying, she had given the ring to Claudia, charging her with keeping it safe and seeing that her daughter received the ring when she was old enough to understand its meaning.

With the ring as her only link to her unknown father, Jelena sets off north, her cousin Magnes by her side. The two cousins make it to the border, but are ambushed by bandits near the bank of a river. Just as the bandits are closing in for the kill, a mounted elven patrol sweeps down upon them. The leader of the elven patrol is Ashinji Sakehera, a young man unhappily constrained by the dictates of a society as tradition-bound and hierarchical as its Soldaran counterpart. Ashinji has been troubled by a dream, one in which a half-elven girl cries out to him for help, only to be swallowed up by a mysterious force of unspeakable menace. He has no idea what the dream means, but he will soon find out its significance as he rushes headlong into a stunning confrontation at the river\'s edge.

Meanwhile, an ancient entity, imprisoned and unconscious for a millennium, has at long last awakened. Implacably evil, its lust for revenge upon those who stripped it of power and exiled it to the eternal dark is second only to its desire to reclaim the key to its lost magic, a magic that will allow it to escape its prison and destroy, then remake, the material world to suit its own purpose. The entity with no name knows the magical key resides within a vessel, a living being that carries the energy in the form of a blue fire...

\""Jabez was more honorable than his brothers. His mother named him \'Jabez\' saying, \'Because I bore him with pain.\' Now, Jabez called on the God of Israel saying, \'Oh, Lord, bless me indeed and expand my territory. Keep Your hand on me, and keep evil from me, that I may not cause pain!\' And God granted him what he requested.\""

Nothing is known about the man who voiced this heartfelt cry to God. He appears to be a man whose family was erased from Israel\'s history. But if the man and his family\'s memories were erased, why is he mentioned at all? And why does his prayer appear in a listing of the members of the tribe of Judah?

In \""Jabez: Conceived in Pain, Delivered in Victory\"" we meet the man behind the prayer. We discover why his family could not be mentioned in the chronicles of the tribes. We learn why he was more honorable than his brothers.

More importantly, we find a man with whom many of us can identify. He is a man with a pitiful past and no hope for a future. He is a man who struggles to find meaning and significance in life. He is a man who is desperate to be accepted by his fellow man.

But most of all, he is a man who craves a relationship with God.

In the end, Jabez turns out to be more than an obscure man in a forgotten time. Instead, he is found to be a man whose prayer had a significant impact on the history of Israel. Though the story takes places over 3,000 years ago, its impact still affects us today.

Carefully consider the joy of your soft-headed ignorance before you begin to run, flip, and jump along the Ninja Path.
  
After much debate and in a spirit of morbid amusement, the International Order of Ninjas has chosen to produce The Ninja Handbook, the first-ever secret ninja training guide specifically designed for the non-ninja.

Most non-ninjas who handle these delicate, deadly pages will die-probably in an elaborately horrific and painful manner. But whether your journey lasts five seconds or five days or (rather inconceivably) five years, all those who bravely take up this text and follow the tenets and trials laid out within will die knowing they were as ninja as they possibly could\'ve been.

For the true of heart or the extremely lucky, this powerful and honorable manuscript contains such phenomenal ninja wisdom as:

 - How to create and name your very own lethal ninja clan
 - The proper weapon to use when fighting a vampire pumpkin
 - Why clowns and robots are so dangerous on the Internet
 - Easy-to-follow charts showing when to slice and when to stab
 - How to execute such ultradeadly kicks as the Driving Miss Daisy
 - Why pretty much every ninja movie ever made sucks
 - How to make a shoggoth explode using well-placed foliage
 - What the heck a shoggoth is and why you\'ll need to make it explode
 - Death Aide certification
 - And much more ninjafied enlightenment on every shuriken-sharp page!

"332","The Sugarhouse","2008-10-22 09:40:17","1","0","Autobiographical coming-of- age tale of five working class boys in the historic village of Cooperstown New York. The story centers around a local brothel called the Sugarhouse, operated by Ma Rutledge, the Maple Sugar Madam, and her two saucy, bovine daughters, Bertha and Emma.

“The happiest times at the Sugarhouse came when Ma Rutledge was making maple syrup. During these sap-boiling days the sugary breath of the candy kitchen penetrated everywhere. The beds of the girls were saturated with sweetness. A roll in the hay with Emma or Bertha was like rolling in pastry flour.”

But there’s trouble in paradise.

A new girl arrives at the Sugarhouse, Belle Saint Marie, “a dusky Cajun princess with snapping black eyes and a body no man could ever forget once he\'d seen it.” A lovers’ triangle develops, with tragic consequences for local hayshaker Paul Greenfield. 

“Guy DeWolfe and Belle Saint Marie were cut from the same cloth. That was obvious to everyone. The two of them were full of cayenne pepper. It was the French blood that surged in their veins. They were perfectly mated, like a pair of ocelots, hot-natured, highly strung, super-sexed and ferocious. Poor Paul Greenfield, who was easily the dullest man in Otsego County, simply didn\'t stand a chance.”

Twenty years later. The author returns to Cooperstown, having lost touch with his four childhood friends. What has become of them? And the Sugarhouse? 

“Supposing the whole town had been bulldozed away to make room for a strip mall, what one thing would I want to remain, to remain forever? Immediately I thought of the Sugarhouse. Yes, the Sugarhouse. Smash everything if you must, but don\'t destroy the Sugarhouse. That was my prayer.”","Donald O\'Donovan","http://www.freewebs.com/theragman","http://media.podiobooks.com/pbpromos/Promo-Sugarhouse-01.mp3","49001","TheSugarhouse.jpg","1","7","0","the-sugarhouse","0","1","http://www.podiobooks.com/blog/2008/10/22/the-sugarhouse/",,,,,,,"0","1","4.5","4.5","4.5","3","by-nc-nd","Literature",NULL,NULL,NULL

Across America, a mysterious pathogen transforms ordinary people into raging killers, psychopaths driven by a terrifying, alien agenda. The human race fights back, yet after every battle the disease responds, adapts, using sophisticated strategies and brilliant ruses to fool its pursuers. The only possible explanation: the epidemic is driven not by evolution but by some malevolent intelligence.

Standing against this unimaginable threat is a small group, assembled under the strictest secrecy. Their best weapon is hulking former football star Perry Dawsey, left psychologically shattered by his own struggles with this terrible enemy, who possesses an unexplainable ability to locate the disease’s hosts. Violent and unpredictable, Perry is both the nation’s best hope and a terrifying liability. Hardened CIA veteran Dew Phillips must somehow forge a connection with him if they’re going to stand a chance against this maddeningly adaptable opponent. Alongside them is Margaret Montoya, a brilliant epidemiologist who fights for a cure even as she reels under the weight of endless horrors.

These three and their team have kept humanity in the game, but that’s not good enough anymore, not when the disease turns contagious, triggering a fast countdown to Armageddon. Meanwhile, other enemies join the battle, and a new threat — one that comes from a most unexpected source — may ultimately prove the most dangerous of all.

Catapulting the reader into a world where humanity’s life span is measured in hours and the president’s finger hovers over the nuclear button, rising star Scott Sigler takes us on a breathtaking, hyper-adrenalized ride filled with terror and jaw-dropping action. Contagious is a truly grand work of suspense, science, and horror from a new master.

"343","Heart of the Ronin","2008-12-12 14:16:06","1","0","Thirteenth-century Japan is a dangerous place, even in a time of peace.  Capricious gods, shape-changing animals, and bloodthirsty demons are as real and unpleasant as a gang of vicious bandits.  From the wilderness emerges a young, idealistic warrior with his father’s mysterious sword on his hip, a wise, sarcastic dog at his side, and a yearning in his heart to find a worthy master.  He dreams only of being samurai. Little does he suspect the agony and glory that await him when his dreams come true.

Finding a master should be easy for a warrior as skilled as Ken’ishi, but the generations-long wars for the Imperial throne have ended.  The land has settled into an uneasy peace and cast multitudes of proud, powerful warriors to the four winds.  The new peace means that these masterless warriors, ronin, often must stoop to crime and banditry to feed themselves.  Ken’ishi finds himself plagued by the hatred and mistrust of peasants and samurai alike.

When he saves a noble maiden from a pack of bandits, he and his faithful dog become enmeshed in the intrigues of samurai lords, vengeful constables, Mongol spies, and a shadowy underworld crime boss known as Green Tiger.  But Ken’ishi has a few secret weapons of his own, granted to him by his mysterious past and his magical upbringing.  If only he knew more about his mysterious past, his parents’ murder, and the sword that seems to want to talk to him. . . .

Heart of the Ronin is an action-packed historical fantasy, set against the backdrop of ancient intrigue and impending war, the first of a sweeping three-part epic filled with deadly duels and climactic battles.  Creatures of folklore and myth are as real as the katana in one’s hand.  And just as deadly.

\""A fusion of historical fiction and adventure fantasy, the first volume of Heermann\'s Ronin Trilogy is a page-turning folkloric narrative of epic proportions. In a strange, supernatural feudal Japan, 17-year-old warrior Ken\'ishi, a masterless samurai with a mysterious past and a legendary sword, saves the life of Kazuko, a powerful lord\'s daughter. Soon he becomes entangled in a deadly web of treachery, obsession and vengeance along with a bevy of conspirators, spies, assassins and otherworldly monstrosities. Though Heermann does little to push the boundaries of the subgenre, his writing style is confident and fluid, his characters are well developed and his serpentine story line anything but predictable. Numerous tantalizingly unresolved plot threads will have readers anxiously awaiting the second installment in this gripping tale of ill-fated love, betrayal and destiny. \"" - PUBLISHERS WEEKLY

"351","Boone Barnaby","2009-01-12 08:24:52","1","0","If you liked Clear Heart, I think you\'ll like this one too.  It’s got great characters, it’s down-to-earth, it’s fun.  And better yet, this one\'s friendly to children.  Boone Barnaby is about three boys testing the limits of life in their scrappy little town.  It’s about collecting garbage, climbing trees, catching a criminal, and talking to dragonflies.  

Boone Barnaby lives in a small town full of large characters:  San Puerco, California.  There’s Boone’s father, who loves Studebakers and doo-wop, and who has a habit of walking around the dark streets of town late at night carrying a can of gasoline.  There’s Boone’s friend Danny, who has nothing—sometimes not even a home—but who wants everything, even if he has to steal for it.  There’s Boone’s other friend Babcock, who finds trilobites and organizes a picket line and looks like a wet coconut.  There’s Walt, the soccer coach, who drives a Harley-Davidson motorcycle.  And there’s Boone himself, who has a few problems:  His soccer team is thrown out of the league.  The dogcatcher is after Boone\'s dog.  The town hoodlum is throwing rocks.  Boone\'s father is arrested for burning down houses. The adult world doesn\'t seem fair, but with the help of his friends—Danny and Babcock—Boone tries to make things right and maybe learn just who he is and what he stands for.  

Boone Barnaby is Part One of the San Puerco Trilogy, three award-winning novels that have been loved by adults and children alike, about the adventures of three boys in a town of cranks and dreamers—and adventurous children.  “This warmly engaging story is resplendent with humor, irony, thoughtful introspection, and well-paced plotting.\"" —School Library Journal.

Joe Cottonwood lives in the scrappy little town of La Honda, California, which has its own share of cranks and dreamers—and adventurous children.  He has written four award-winning novels for children including the best-selling Quake!, four novels for adults including Famous Potatoes and Clear Heart, a book of poetry, and numerous songs.  He has worked as a plumber, electrician, and carpenter and currently makes his living as a building contractor.  He recently discovered that he has been writing podcasts all his life, though he didn’t know it until podcasts were finally invented.

(One note before you listen:  The novel was written in 1988 before every house had a computer, every person could get a cell phone, and every mom drove an SUV.  It was written when every President was a white man.  It wasn’t all that long ago.)","Joe Cottonwood","http://joecottonwood.com","http://media.podiobooks.com/pbpromos/PB-BooneBarnaby-promo.mp3","29814","BooneBarnaby.jpg","0","9","3","boone-barnaby","0","1","http://www.podiobooks.com/blog/2009/01/12/boone-barnaby/",,,,,,,"0","0","4.8125","4.8125","4.8125","4.875","by-nc-nd","Literature",,,

An life of luxury, a loving family, and intended bride, and a destiny that would one day see him assume the Eldership of his Clan.

Then, on a dark night in his 12th year of life, four would-be assassins changed all that.  Charged by his father with protecting a sacred artifact, Dalan was left for dead by his attackers, and the artifact subsequently stolen.

One year later, Dalan awakens from a comatose state not only to find his body healed, but also to the fact that his family has disowned him.  Humiliated before his peers, the would-be heir to the Tiger’s Paw Clan is cast out to live amongst the lowest of the low in Bengalan society:

The exiles.

Outcasts from the Clans, the exiles are a society unto themselves, shunned by all and forced to live in secret.  They move through the secular, non-Clan world under the cover of assumed identities, taking jobs where strong backs are favored over questionable pasts.  Through an elaborate underground network known as The Foundation, many exiles have found some glimmer of hope in a world committed to rooting them out and exterminating them like so much vermin.

It is into this world that a 13-year old Dalan is thrust.  With no money and only a tiny bit of martial arts training, the young tiger begins his journey through the dark underbelly of Bengalan society.  His eyes are quickly opened to the true brutality of the Clans, as he bears witness to an act so horrifying that he begins to question all he’d been brought up to believe.

Hope does exist for the young tiger, however…in the form of a mysterious trainer who extends an offer to him.  The offer is to train Dalan in an ancient fighting form…one that will transform him from a desperate, fearful exile into a beast to be feared and respected by all.  The young tiger accepts, and before long finds himself on a journey towards a destiny that will challenge all he’s ever known and believed, and make him see the world in a new, cold light.

He also finds hope in the loving arms of a fellow exile, one from a far off land running from an alleged curse put on her by those who cast her out.  As their love for each other grows, Dalan soon finds himself faced with a choice:  Devote his life to his newfound love and abandon any hope of regaining his honor…

Or risk losing everything for one chance at bloody, unforgiving vengeance…","Chris Hvidsten","http://outcastnovel.wordpress.com","http://media.podiobooks.com/pbpromos/PB-Outcast-Promo.mp3","10792","Outcast.jpg","1","1","0","outcast","1",,"http://www.podiobooks.com/blog/2009/02/04/outcast/",,,,,,,"0","1","4.625","4.625","4","4.375","by-nc-nd","Literature",,,

"377","Wild Animals I Have Known","2009-03-30 10:27:07","1","0","A BOOK THAT CHANGED AMERICA...

Ernest Thompson Seton was an influential naturalist, and a sometime professional hunter and trapper.  Much of this book speaks to the contradictions between these roles.

In November 2008, both the PBS series, \""Nature,\"" and the BBC series, \""Natural World,\"" presented episodes called \""The Wolf That Changed America,\"" about Seton, focused in particular on the first story in this book: \""Lobo, King of the Currumpaw.\""  Their contention was that his experiences in the capture of Lobo made him the outspoken and controversial activist for wildlife preservation he became.

From the Forward:

\""THESE STORIES are true. Although I have left the strict line of historical truth in many places, the animals in this book were all real characters. They lived the lives I have depicted, and showed the stamp of heroism and personality more strongly by far than it has been in the power of my pen to tell...

\""Such a collection of histories naturally suggests a common thought a moral it would have been called in the last century. No doubt each different mind will find a moral to its taste, but I hope some will herein find emphasized a moral as old as Scripture: we and the beasts are kin. Man has nothing that the animals have not at least a vestige of, the animals have nothing that man does not in some degree share. 

\""Since, then, the animals are creatures with wants and feelings differing in degree only from our own, they surely have their rights. This fact, now beginning to be recognized by the Caucasian world, was first proclaimed by Moses and was emphasized by the Buddhist over 2,000 years ago.\""

-- E.T. Seton

\""Lobo\"" is worth hearing.  But you\'ll be intrigued, too, I think, by the rest of the stories.  I was.

But the beauty of the sea belies a terror from the deep-a horrific creature as immense as it is ancient. There is no blood, no scream, no fight. Giona is swallowed whole by the massive jaws. Only Atticus remains to suffer the shame of the survivor and his inconsolable grief turns to an unquenchable thirst for revenge.

Drawn by the spectacle, Trevor Manfred, a ruthless billionaire, approaches Atticus with a proposition: Trevor will make available all the advanced technology of his heavily armed mega-yacht, the Titan, to aid Atticus in his death-quest. In return, Trevor is to receive the beast\'s corpse as the ultimate hunting trophy.  But in the midst of the hunt, Atticus makes a terrifying discovery that changes the way he sees the ocean\'s creatures and begs the question: what is Kronos? The answer sets him on a new and much more deadly course.

Written originally in 1970, it is even more relevant now in an era of rapidly vanishing personal liberty caused by an ever more intrusive and expensive government. “The Market for Liberty” is the antidote to years of government indoctrination, lies and misinformation.

Using clear and concise language, the Tannehills provide an entire rethinking of the whole organization of society, advocating the use of natural law and voluntary interaction as the basis for it rather than the force and coercion of government.

"387","KIRINS: The Spell of No\'an","2009-04-24 10:48:08","1","0","A race of tiny, magical beings lives on Earth today. They dwell in elaborate tree homes and mysterious underground sanctuaries. Because of an ancient dispute, however, humans are unaware of their hidden civilization.

They are kirins.

For thousands of years they lived in peace. But a deadly menace now threatens their existence. A party of daring explorers, led by the wise magician Speckarin, is sent on trained ravens to destroy an evil lurking a continent and an ocean away. Failure of this mission would mean death to the voyagers and the entire kirin race. But their success will depend on aid from a truly unexpected source, human beings.

Fly with these adventurers and witness today\'s world as it has never before been seen. You\'ll find yourself looking to the skies for this mystical race of beings, because maybe, just maybe . . .

The Spell of No\'an is the first book of the KIRINS trilogy. Mary Logue, author of DANCING WITH AN ALIEN, SNATCHED, and numerous other books, says this about the work: \""Having read all three books of James Priest\'s wonderful trilogy, I have nothing but praise. The scope of this work, which takes us from the middle of North America across the Atlantic on the backs of birds to Stonehenge, is extraordinary. I enjoyed every moment I spent with the kirins. Priest\'s work resembles LORD OF THE RINGS, but is more rooted in nature and gentler in tone.\""

"389","Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions","2009-05-06 10:31:44","1","0","Math.  Geometry.  Physics.  Violence?  Is this the same book I read in school?  Yep.

One of the joys of rediscovering old books is that they still have the ability to surprise, even shock.

\""If my poor Flatland friend retained the vigour of mind which he enjoyed when he began to compose these Memoirs, I should not now need to represent him in this preface, in which he desires, fully, to return his thanks to his readers and critics in Spaceland ... But he is not the Square he once was.  Years of imprisonment, and the still heavier burden of general incredulity and mockery, have combined with the thoughts and notions, and much also of the terminology, which he acquired during his short stay in Spaceland. ...\""

You may remember Flatland as a clever children\'s story about squares and triangles and such living a happy life in a sheet of paper, a story about math and geometry and such.  No, not so much.  

Sure, there\'s no Adult Language or Sex.  But there\'s plenty of violence.  I recall recording one scene wherein over 120,000 people were stabbed to death, torn to pieces and eaten by their fellow Flatlanders.  Yes.  Way.

Assuming you consider Isoceles Triangles people.  In Flatland, they are.  Mostly.

\""Imagine a vast sheet of paper on which straight Lines, Triangles, Squares, Pentagons, Hexagons, and other figures, instead of remaining fixed in their places, move freely about, on or in the surface, but without the power of rising above or sinking below it, very much like shadows--only hard with luminous edges--and you will then have a pretty correct notion of my country and countrymen.  Alas, a few years ago, I should have said \'my universe,\' but now my mind has been opened to higher views of things. ...\""

Flatland is very old Hard Science Fiction, if you look at it right.  It\'s clever, satirical, funny and sad.  It includes well-fleshed-out alien society with similarities to our own, several different alternate universes, genetics, politics, religion, slavery, tyranny, war, rebellion, imprisonment, madness, and death.

And math.  And geometry.  And some rather clever Puns.  \""Written by A. Square?\""  Also known as Edwin Abbott Abbott.  Get it?

As if the Brothers Grimm had gotten much, much Grimmer.

\""To The Inhabitance of SPACE IN GENERAL, And H.C. IN PARTICULAR, This Work is Dedicated By a Humble Native of Flatland, In the Hope that Even as he was Initiated into the Mysteries Of THREE DIMENSIONS, Having been previously conversant With ONLY TWO, So the Citizens of that Celestial Region May aspire yet higher and higher, To the Secrets of FOUR, FIVE, or EVEN SIX Dimensions, Thereby contributing To the Enlargment of THE IMAGINATION, And the possible Development Of that most and excellent Gift of MODESTY, Among the Superior Races Of SOLID HUMANITY.\""

"393","Personal Effects: Sword of Blood","2009-05-15 19:08:43","1","0","Brinkvale Psychiatric Hospital art therapist Zach Taylor is endlessly curious, perhaps to a fault. When his cheerful elderly patient Gertrude “Spindle” Spindler completes her latest quilt and informs Zach that a 30-year-old \""grand design of nine\"" has just concluded, Zach’s curiosity is piqued ... and he soon embarks on a quest to unwind the meaning of the woman\'s cryptic phrase.

He isn\'t expecting a descent into a world filled with mystery and ruthless subcultures -- and he isn\'t expecting to be haunted by Spindle\'s coy clues. What is The Great Blade of Blood? What are The Charred? What is the grand design of nine? And who is the dark-skinned stranger stalking Zach at every turn, threatening his life?

The answers may lie in Spindle\'s granddaughter, a willowy self-proclaimed psychic named Hen. But Zach soon discovers that Hen may be crazier than the patients he treats ... and the treasure he\'s pursuing may be more dangerous -- and deadly -- than he ever imagined.

But it\'s not only the joy of words that keeps him grinding; it\'s his desire to retire the janitor\'s mop. He sees being published as the key to living an improved life. James has another deep-seated conviction: that he\'s not good enough. He secretly longs to be accepted. However, the conventional others in his life seem all too willing to remind him that he\'s wasting his time.

Then he meets and falls in love with Leigh, the one bright spot in his endless misery of self-doubt. A quiet but resolutely religious girl, she has to fight off disapproval of her own from overly critical parents, whose insults are countered by James\'s often-voiced admiration of her. Likewise, Leigh\'s faith in his talents begins to build his confidence, eventually allowing her to introduce him to a different way to help himself: relying on God.

Ultimately, James\'s newfound faith is sorely tested to the point of doubt when his dream to be published seems to melt into a mirage, smothered by countless rejection slips from agents and publishers. His faith is also battered by having to fight highly emotional battles and suffer fear and loss. Just when James appears hopelessly sapped by devastating events, one last door opens, and he\'s rocked by an epiphany.

When one of their misplaced, but deadly artifacts falls into the hands of young street-poet \'Razer\', he is launched into the middle of a clan war that has been waged across the World for millenia.

Events triggered thousands of years ago are about to reach a climax that not only threatens Scotland, but could finally hand the modern World the tools of its own destruction.","Mick Bordet","http://someotherscotland.blogspot.com",,"59758","SomeOtherScottland.jpg","0","12","0","some-other-scotland","0",,"http://www.podiobooks.com/blog/2009/07/17/some-other-scotland/",,,,,,,"0","0","5","4.75","4.25","4.5","by-nc-nd","Places & Travel",,,

"422","Heretics","2009-08-22 13:03:09","1","0","\""Heretics,\"" a series of essays by Gilbert Keith Chesterton. First published in 1905. Read by David \""Grizzly\"" Smith.

Chesterton had a sense of humor, had a sense of drama, and had sense. He was a man of strong opinions, and quite willing to argue vehemently for his own opinions, even with his friends -- and they remained his friends -- like George Bernard Shaw and Rudyard Kipling. Seems to me that is hard to find anymore.

He wrote prolifically. He wrote humor. He wrote mystery novels, the Father Brown mysteries in particular. But he also wrote his opinions, his religious opinions and his opinions about religion.

\""Heretics\"" is a book about religion and politics, theory and fact, morals and efficiency. What I most admire about \""Heretics,\"" written a bit over a century ago, is that his arguments are exceptional, and that so many of them are still quite recognizably true. He argues that the weakening and devaluing of religion has also weakened and devalued heresy. He argues that people should be able to speak freely -- but that freedom of speech has actually decreased people\'s willingness to speak about important issues. And so much more.

The one disclaimer I feel I must offer is that this book was \""timely.\"" Some of the people and events he mentions will be familiar. Many other people and events would have been familiar to you, if you\'d lived in England at the beginning of the last century. The ideas he opposes, however, are either regaining popularity, or have never lost it. And his arguments are as valid and wise now as they were.

In some ways, he was ahead of his time. You may disagree with him, but you can\'t deny his intelligence and wisdom. This isn\'t the book you might expect it to be. I think you\'ll enjoy it, and maybe even learn something. Even if you disagree.

"424","Babcock","2009-08-26 09:22:08","1","0","A fat boy with the blues.  A skinny girl who runs marathons.  And a con man on the lam.  If you liked Clear Heart, or if you liked Boone Barnaby, you’ll like this one, too.  The themes are a bit more grown up than Boone Barnaby, but it’s still family-friendly for reading.  For any age it’s my brand of writing:  humane, down to earth, good-natured, sometimes funny and sometimes sad.

Babcock plays electric guitar.  He’s writing songs - and trying to figure out the true meaning of rock and roll - but he keeps coming up with the blues.  Babcock is trying to start a friendship with a girl, Kirsten, who is as different as can be:  Kirsten is skinny; she hates insects.  And she\'s white.  Babcock is fat; he speaks to dragonflies.  And he’s black.

In some ways Kirsten is like a dragonfly:  quick and bright.  She never walks; she runs everywhere.  Her family has money.  Her mother thinks Babcock is a little too \""rough.\""  Opposites attract.  But can they make music?

Babcock\'s family is struggling for money.  Then Babcock\'s Uncle Earl moves in - and he moves into Babcock\'s bedroom with Babcock\'s menagerie of animals (including Martin Luther Kingsnake.).  Uncle Earl is a con man on the lam.  Uncle Earl used to play drums for Chuck Berry.  Babcock wants to be Chuck Berry.  Uncle Earl wants to coach a Little League baseball team - as a “business venture.”  Babcock hates baseball.  Babcock wants to learn \""charm\"" from Uncle Earl.  Uncle Earl wants to learn how to live a normal life and marry a normal woman - who happens to be Babcock\'s schoolteacher.  Maybe Babcock and Uncle Earl have something to teach each other.

Babcock\'s father runs a car repair shop.  At night, in the kitchen, he draws cartoons.  Some day he wants to quit repairing cars and sell his cartoons.  But nobody\'s buying.

Kirsten is hotheaded.  Sometimes she needs protection - from herself.  Her mother tries to protect her - from Babcock.  For help with his problems Babcock goes to an unlikely source: his Uncle Earl, the man with good charm and bad behavior.  But the biggest lessons from Uncle Earl - and, perhaps, from rock and roll - are not what anyone expected.

In short, it’s about character.  About making music.  About family, hard work, about love and loss.  Sometimes there’s laughter.  Sometimes the lights are off in the kitchen; papa’s got blues.  But always life is rich and deeply moving...

I call Babcock a post-Obama novel.  It’s about the friendship of a black boy with a white girl, and it isn’t about racial issues - well, not much.  Have we really reached that point?  Is our cup half full?  The odd thing is, I wrote this novel in 1992 when nobody, including me, had heard of Barack Obama and when book critics wanted bloody racial conflict whenever black and white characters mixed in the pages of a novel.  Maybe I was 16 years ahead of the times.

Babcock is part of the San Puerco trilogy, which makes it a companion book to <a href=\""http://podiobooks.com/title/boone-barnaby\"">Boone Barnaby</a>:  same characters (plus a few new ones) and more adventures in the scrappy little town of San Puerco.  The book won awards as a novel for children, but it has many adult fans, too.  Most of the issues appeal to an adult perspective as well as a child’s, though with different understanding.  Other issues, of course, only a young person can understand.  That’s life.  That’s rock and roll.","Joe Cottonwood","http://joecottonwood.com","http://media.podiobooks.com/pbpromos/PB-Babcock-Promo.mp3","29814","Babcock.jpg","0","9","3","babcock","0","1","http://www.podiobooks.com/blog/2009/08/26/babcock/",,,,,,,"0","0","4.6","5","5","5","Literature","Literature",,,

Ten years ago, Nina Kimberly the Merciless was cheated out of the life of adventure that she truly deserves. Her father, the fearsome barbarian conqueror Marcus the Merciless, met his first and only defeat at the hands of, well... a gopher hole. Ever since this epic humiliation, she and the rest of the horde have been stuck in the rural backwater kingdom of Langia. Now Francis IX, the idiotic king, has decided that he and Nina should be married. She can\'t kill him without starting a succession war, but the alternatives? Eww! Nina has long yearned for a hero to sweep her up on a glorious quest, but Francis\' unwanted affections have forced her hand. No more waiting for a quest to find *her*, it\'s time to get proactive. She sets off into the big wide world, but the King decides to tag along, complete with a security spell to alert the Kingdom if he\'s killed. Nina is forced to swallow her pride and keep him safe... at least until she can find a way to break the spell. But nothing is ever simple in the life of a barbarian princess, and nothing is ever quite what it appears. The dragon is a pacifist (sometimes). The handsome rogue is a con-artist, but who is he conning? And even the wizard has a few surprises in store. While seeking the answer to all her problems, Miss the Merciless discovers that what she\'s always wanted may not actually be what she *wants*. *Nina Kimberly the Merciless* is a comic coming of age story filled with magic, mayhem and mercenaries, but mercy? Never.

      It will NOT guarantee success – Life holds no promises!
      It will NOT guarantee happiness – Ignorance is bliss!


There is a secret. It is not the one you have seen so well advertised in the media. It has little to do with positive thinking and really getting in touch with your true purpose in life.

Those people you read about in People magazine and see on television know it. Those people who enjoy the lives we would love to have – will never reveal this basic truth. It would be like a magician giving away their secret, and secret it is – the real secret! You won’t read or hear about this one… when you find out what it is, you will know why!

Life is too often a sucker’s game. Those who play by the rules, believe in fair play, and believe that what goes around comes around in life, are very often the greatest losers in life.

In every one of life’s arenas there is a “Hidden Game.” While the rank and file are all busy with trying to win the brass ring, there is a small group of insiders, the “Players,” who are coolly, cynically, pulling the strings.

These “Players” take the lion’s share of life’s rewards – the beautiful homes, the cars, the svelte spouses – leaving the rest of humanity to fight over the crumbs they leave behind.

Imagine, what it would be like to be able to recognize this pattern – know how it works, and predict what will happen next? It would be like having a crystal ball – always one step ahead of the game, knowing what is going to happen next!

You will have the confidence which comes from knowing that life is a Game – and you have THE EDGE!","John Berling Hardy","http://www.havewebeenplayed.com","http://media.podiobooks.com/pbpromos/PB-HaveWeBeenPlayed-Promo.mp3","61379","HaveWeBeenPlayed.jpg","0","33","0","have-we-been-played","0","1","http://www.podiobooks.com/blog/2009/09/02/have-we-been-played-the-hidden-game-revealed/",,,,,,,"0","0","5","5","5","5","by-nc-nd","Philosophy",,,

In the Port of Call bar on Space Station Sidon a man sits at a card game. He’s ruthless, he’s unforgiving, and he almost never loses. His name is Alex Hart, and he is waiting for someone.

Reuben Briggs never could play nice with others. As a professor he couldn’t stay out of trouble. As the National Security Advisor he couldn’t resist using other people’s secrets to leverage his agenda. He always attracted the wrong kind of attention, and in 2125 that attention turned deadly. A Lunar judge wants his secrets, a corrupt senator wants him dead, the Green Lady wants his fealty, and Alex Hart wants to play cards with him.

Walking into the Port of Call, Briggs thinks he’s left all the bounty hunters behind him. But in the looking-glass world above the gravity well, he’s about to discover that survival, like poker, is just another sport.

An illicit affair with a contest judge costs him not only the competition crown, but his musical credibility as well.  Fleeing the media fallout, Calvin exiles himself to the backwoods town of Harvey, Virginia. With a little solitude and a lot of cheap beer, he plans to write the next great rock and roll album and resurrect his career.  But Calvin doesn\'t know that a man has just been buried alive in the woods outside of town, and that this quiet murder is just the first in a string of macabre events.  As the town goes silently mad around him, Calvin is unable to abandon the record of his dreams.

This engaging story is most often described as a hybrid of Star Wars, The Godfather, and Any Given Sunday.

The Rookie is set amongst a lethal pro football league 700 years in the future. Aliens play positions based on physiology, creating receivers that jump 25 feet into the air, linemen that bench-press 1,200 pounds, and linebackers that literally want to eat you. Organized crime runs every franchise, games are fixed, and rival players are assassinated.

Follow the story of Quentin Barnes, a 19 year-old quarterback prodigy that has been raised all his life to loathe those aliens. He was taught rhymes in school about how to kill them. Quentin must deal with his racism and learn to lead, or he will wind up just another casualty on the football field.
            
\""The remastered version of Scott Sigler\'s novel \'The Rookie\' is a real treat for the audiophile.  Listeners who use headphones while enjoying audiobooks or podcasts will find these remastered episodes to be particularly rich in sound and quality.  All incidental noises, hums or hisses have been removed, leaving only a robust vocal performance by the author.  Furthermore, rather than having to adjust volume levels between episodes there is a seamless consistency in quality and volume from episode to episode, resulting in a cohesive listening experience.\""

\""Listening to the re-master of \'The Rookie\' I found myself drawn further into this intense story. When your heart races every time the ball gets snapped and you hold your breath when Barnes drops back for a pass, you know you\'re into the story.

            -Jason Williamson
            
\""The re-mastered version of \'The Rookie\' is a great introduction to the Scott Sigler universe. Mr. Sigler gives each alien race its own instantly recognizable voice. The podcasts are much more like the old-time radio dramas than someone simply reading. My husband and I enjoyed listening together and were drawn into the excitement of the football games, the intrigue of the alien underworld, and the funny, fantastic, and compelling characters.
