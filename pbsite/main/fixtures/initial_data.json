Some of the titles (which may give you an idea of the content) are: \"The Calls of Cthulu\", \"All I Need to Learn, I Learned From Kindergarten Cop\", \"Diary of a Grocery Cart\", \"Dionysus: Party Clown\", and \"A Brief Conversation with My Hair\".  The forty-plus pieces in this collection find the bizarre in the everyday or some bit of the everyday in the already bizarre.  If you ever wondered if Allen Ginsburg could have put his considerable talent to writing pay-per-click ads or how Calvin and Hobbes may have responded to reading Hemingway, you will find the answers here.",

But the girl turns out to belong to the chief Maoist -- and he turns out to harbor alarming aspirations in the field of revolutionary terror. And so Fenton, wearing a forcibly grown beard, finds himself propelled into a bizarre covert world of death lists, backyard bomb labs, untraceable handguns, and attempted wet jobs of wildly varying quality -- a world in which he must choose between losing the girl forever or else participating, perhaps very soon, in a successful terrorist atrocity.\r\n \r\nAlong the way he must contend with a motley cast of characters, few of whom enjoy optimal grips on reality. There is Gus, the Maoist kingpin who in his quest to become a practising terrorist will draw the line at nothing, not even a car bombing (\"I'm listening, mate -- provided you're not referring to my Kombi.\") There is the fiery student radical Pamela Scratch, linked to Fenton by an infinitely regrettable sex act perpetrated in a sandpit at the age of five. And there is the incarcerated and patently guilty multiple murderer Neville Claude Aggot, whose spectacular escape augments the already long list of impending homicides that Fenton must at least try to avert as the novel hurtles, like a Kombi full of high explosive, towards its climax...",

It takes everything you thought you knew about the Star Wars saga and flips it around to expose the ugly underbelly of the Rebellion, The Jedi, and everything else.\r\n\r\n<i>A Different Point of View</i> has rapidly become one of the most popular segments on Wingin' It!, and if you've missed any, now is your chance to catch up on them and find out why TD-0013 is everyone's favorite Stormtrooper.  You also might just end up being one of the many who've discovered that the Empire were the \"good guys\" all along.\r\n\r\nFor the past six films in the saga, you've heard the Rebels' side of the story, now it's time for <i>A Different Point of View</i>.\r\n\r\n<b>Warning:</b> These segments are rated PG-13 for the use of \"Soldier Language\" and dealing with some subjects a bit too much for younger fans of the saga.",

But on the last day of classes and dreaming about a gorgeous gal, he woke up in a white washed world with nothing there! ... That included his clothes (oops). He found himself on the other side of the mirrors and could look out of any mirror. With a few false starts (didn't that woman ever hear of someone asking for directions), he got himself out and back into the real world and his own home ... He then wished he stayed put.\r\n\r\nA wizard from a race of humanoid toads wanted Vern to come to his world to aid in defending the toads from two different races. Vern's talents were hidden - he was a special bachelor (did that mean \"easy to get rid of\"?). He would be a powerful though inexperienced wizard in the other world. \"Please come, the situation is desperate\", pleaded the toad. Vern, of course, refused. Then after some persuading (and turning Vern's world even more upside down), Vern said he'd think about it.\r\n\r\nSunday morning, Vern found himself in another world. \"I said I'd THINK about it!\" snapped Vern. But he was now committed. After meeting a few individuals who wanted to slice, dice, or otherwise harm him, Vern got into the quest. Then he met a beautiful Red unicorn stallion with magical powers. The unicorn took immediately to Vern. Vern was thrilled - then he remembered why unicorns took to certain people ... Vern didn't have too much success in dating (he swore he was a good kisser). Hopefully, he'll have more success in staying alive.",

               "description": "Do you think its easy being an alien, a satanic creature or anything else not considered part of the Homo sapiens only club? They have tough days just like humans do and their frustration is growing. Don't believe it? Well, what about Lucifer, the prince of darkness, who runs a car dealership--what about his feelings when he is faced with that impossible sale and he can't get that signature on form 666, the standard soul contract? Or maybe you wondered about how an extremely vain alien copes with having a bad hair day as he tries to alter the future of Earth? Will his cosmetic problems be our problems in other ways? Perhaps you heard about the opposite vampire who loves to give blood, hates the darkness and has a fetish for garlic - how does he get through a bad relationship? How about a DNA altered cat that has been given the personality of one of the world's most fearsome criminals? Will its human owners understand or will it be a less then purr-fect arrangement? \r\n\r\nWhat's the common thread do all this discontent, you ask? What is it about most stories that stay the same? It's the human! These aliens and demonic creatures are sick and tired of being the second fiddle in the story. They want what everybody wants: to be the center of attention of the stories instead of the pesky humans for a change...and now they finally get their wish. In Aliens and Satanic Creatures Wanted: Humans Need Not Apply, they finally get top billing and they exploit it as far as they can. \r\n",

               "description": "'All Sorts of People - Ordered Complexity' is a collection of seven linked books:\r\n\r\nBook One presents personality differences - we may describe you, your family, your friends, in a great deal of detail. We develop symmetries between the various forms of thought. This will help us later as we map things onto the human brain.\r\n\r\nBook Two examines the energy engine of the mind, the source of our excitement. This form of thought operates strongly in one personality style and gives it 'charisma.' We'll look at multiple historical persons, using direct quotes chained together from published historical biographies. That way you know we aren't making this up.\r\n\r\nBook Three analyzes typical compatibilities and conflicts, and uses this information, with the symmetries developed previously, to generate a static model of the human mind. Surprisingly, there turn out to be only about eight common marriage combinations.\r\n\r\nBook 4 looks at a second personality style - it's the basis for sensitivity, and thus for human interaction and love. We examine its development, in persons from history, again using only direct quotes from historical biographies.\r\n\r\nBooks 5, 6 and 7 are too sensitive to put on to audio. Thus, we leave them for you to read by yourself - they can be downloaded from our website at www.cognitivestyles.com.\r\n\r\nThese seven books, taken together, provide a possible explanation for human consciousness - this is the Holy Grail of the social sciences. We leave it for you to judge how well we succeed.\r\n\r\nA series of <a href=\"http://www.philosophyunveiled.blip.tv/\">accompanying videos for the lectures</a> have been made available.",

When a strange old man stops at nothing to tell Amber that the legendary stone is meant for her, it frightens her and her family deeply.

               "description": "Throughout the 1920s the Common University provided a free and ready source of education to the working classes of England through various lecture series and the distribution of educative pamphlets in the East End. At the time it renowned as a philanthropic exercise noted more for its good intentions than its practice of asking for lecturers' credentials. In the mid 1930s it shut down amid a small furore over the nonsense it was teaching. It was assumed by all involved that that would be the end of it.\r\n\r\nThen, toward the end of the 1990s the English poet A.F. Harrold discovered a box of papers in the attic of an elderly stranger. After exhaustive investigations, leads followed and clues uncovered he discovered that what he held in his hands were lecture notes, reports of speeches, lessons and seminars from the Common University long thought lost by educational historians. \"Gosh,\" he thought, \"This stuff's jolly interesting.\"\r\n\r\nLooking into the history of the Common University he found that the lives of those involved in it were surprisingly exciting and he dramatised those events and those intrepid people in a series of novels that begin with The Curious Education of Epitome Quirkstandard.

Funded by the biotech firm Genada, Dr. Claus Rhumkorrf seeks to recreate the ancestor of all mammals. By getting back to the root of our creation, Rhumkorrf hopes to create an animal with human internal organs. Rhumkorrf discovers the ancestor, but it is not the small, harmless creature he envisions. His genius gives birth to a fast-growing evil that nature eradicated 250 million years ago -- an evil now on the loose, and very, very hungry.\r\n\r\nAlso by Scott Sigler - <a href=\"http://podiobooks.com/podiobooks/book.php?ID=24\">Earthcore</a>.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://technorati.com/claim/hu5enxhn2s\" rel=\"me\">Technorati Profile</a>",

Once discovering what this power was and what it enabled him to do, Gabriel became Axiom-man, a symbol of hope in a city that had none.\r\n\r\nOne night after a routine patrol, a mysterious black cloud appears over the city. Flying over to investigate it, Axiom-man is stopped short when the cloud's presence shakes him to the core. An electrifying fear emanates from the cloud and he can barely get near it. Quickly, the cloud takes flight and leads him on a wild goose chase throughout the city, only to flee from him in the end. Almost immediately after the cloud's appearance, a new hero arises, Redsaw, clad in a black cape and cowl. The people, now enamored with this new super-powered marvel, seem to have forgotten about Axiom-man and all he's done for them.\r\n\r\nExcept something's wrong. That same fear that emanated from the cloud drips off Redsaw like a foul smell and Axiom-man can barely get close to him without feeling ill.\r\n\r\nWhat is Redsaw's agenda and who is he? And why is it every time Axiom-man gets close to him it feels as if his powers are being sucked away?\r\n\r\nAs if that wasn't enough, Gabriel's day job hasn't gotten any easier. His co-worker and the woman he adores, Valerie Vaughan, has little interest in him, and his boss has made it clear that one more day late to work will be the day he cleans out his desk. Then there's the new trainee, Gene Nemek. What is his fascination with Redsaw and why is he never around when Redsaw appears?\r\n\r\nFrom flying over city streets and soaring at dizzying heights, to balancing a secret identity with destiny, Axiom-man must discover what Redsaw's presence means and how it ties into the messenger's life-altering visit before the city\u2014and the world\u2014are enamored with an evil that has haunted the cosmos since the dawn of Time.\r\n\r\n\"Axiom-man is that unique breed of superhero that seems almost lost\r\namid today's gaggle of the dark and tormented. He's nice, he cares,\r\nand his strength comes not from his fantastic powers, but from his\r\nsoul. A.P. Fuchs has written a defining superhero novel.\"\r\n- Frank Dirscherl, author/creator of <i>The Wraith</i>\r\n\r\n\"Reading <i>Axiom-man</i> is refreshing, like reading about the early\r\ndays of Peter Parker, but with a cooler villain as well.\"\r\nJon Klement, author/creator of <i>Rush and the Grey Fox</i>\r\n\r\n\"<i>Axiom-man</i> was well worth reading and recommending.

And better yet, this one's friendly to children.  Boone Barnaby is about three boys testing the limits of life in their scrappy little town.  It\u2019s about collecting garbage, climbing trees, catching a criminal, and talking to dragonflies.  \r\n\r\nBoone Barnaby lives in a small town full of large characters:  San Puerco, California.  There\u2019s Boone\u2019s father, who loves Studebakers and doo-wop, and who has a habit of walking around the dark streets of town late at night carrying a can of gasoline.  There\u2019s Boone\u2019s friend Danny, who has nothing\u2014sometimes not even a home\u2014but who wants everything, even if he has to steal for it.  There\u2019s Boone\u2019s other friend Babcock, who finds trilobites and organizes a picket line and looks like a wet coconut.  There\u2019s Walt, the soccer coach, who drives a Harley-Davidson motorcycle.  And there\u2019s Boone himself, who has a few problems:  His soccer team is thrown out of the league.  The dogcatcher is after Boone's dog.  The town hoodlum is throwing rocks.  Boone's father is arrested for burning down houses. The adult world doesn't seem fair, but with the help of his friends\u2014Danny and Babcock\u2014Boone tries to make things right and maybe learn just who he is and what he stands for.  \r\n\r\nBoone Barnaby is Part One of the San Puerco Trilogy, three award-winning novels that have been loved by adults and children alike, about the adventures of three boys in a town of cranks and dreamers\u2014and adventurous children.  \u201cThis warmly engaging story is resplendent with humor, irony, thoughtful introspection, and well-paced plotting.\" \u2014School Library Journal.\r\n\r\nJoe Cottonwood lives in the scrappy little town of La Honda, California, which has its own share of cranks and dreamers\u2014and adventurous children.  He has written four award-winning novels for children including the best-selling Quake!, four novels for adults including Famous Potatoes and Clear Heart, a book of poetry, and numerous songs.  He has worked as a plumber, electrician, and carpenter and currently makes his living as a building contractor.  He recently discovered that he has been writing podcasts all his life, though he didn\u2019t know it until podcasts were finally invented.\r\n\r\n(One note before you listen:  The novel was written in 1988 before every house had a computer, every person could get a cell phone, and every mom drove an SUV.  It was written when every President was a white man.  It wasn\u2019t all that long ago.)",

The balance of power is thrown askew by the addition of not one more Superpower, but <em>six thousand</em>.\r\n\r\nBefore the Donner Declaration, high school sophomore Nate Charters was just an outsider and self-proclaimed freak.  His unusual appearance, hair-trigger reflexes, and overactive metabolism should have made him something special, but his differences and low self-esteem have long since marked him as a target for the jocks and popular kids.\r\n\r\nNow, just as his unique nature brings him the attention of a self-assured older girl, Nate must find his place in the world.  Why is he the way he is?  Where did he come from?  Is he part of a remarkable, powerful new minority... or just a misfit among misfits?\r\n\r\nHe'd better find out fast...  others want the truth, and they're closing in...\r\n\r\n<b>Praise For <em>\"Brave Men Run - A Novel of the Sovereign Era\"</em></b>\r\n\r\n<em>\"The brilliance of</em> Brave Men Run <em>is not only in its vision, but its execution.

They maintain a permanent connection to the internet.\r\n\r\nIn this satire of everything you love about B Movies and black-and-white ideologies, Mark Plimsoll presents adult themes with elegance and style, buried in jargon, in a way suitable for children of all ages.  Told without mind-numbing explosions or car chases, unlike Television with its hand-to-hand combat (without injured hands) and sexual titillation without a human context, Cell UR asks us to use our intelligence and imagination.\r\n\r\nWill Gnathan receive his new Personal Customized Transporter in time to invite Vampire Elvirus to tattoo his obese backside on the beach as the sun sets, to realize four of his life goals?  Will the Siliconoid Aliens catch the reality show's Spaceship Rambler before Andrea loses her virginity, and take revenge on all DNA life forms?  Will the illiterate President of Metroplex, Maximiliano Duroc, declare war in a language people understand?  What evil lurks beyond the border, in the Devastate?\r\n\r\nCell-UR describes our near-future in humorous metaphor, as we witness the coming of age of a normal, personality-disordered obese adolescent, as he becomes part of something bigger than himself and learns that true evil has a familiar face, seen in every mirror.\r\n\r\nThe author and reader, Mark Plimsoll, also does production, voices, artwork, and performs the 'novel' futuristic songs in this \"Gothic SciFi Vampire multi-media comedy.\"",

Led by the enigmatic Sean Matts, this group of a dozen skilled men venture out into a small-scale area in the fictional metropolis named Kewanee, righting wrongs that the police are unable to touch.  Initially, they operate from a small garage owned by one of the Checkwolf members, the epitome of a minor operation.  But Sean Matts has a greater vision for his group, one that will take them from their humble beginnings and turn them into a force to be feared.\r\n\r\nThe Checkwolf series is a collection of stories chronicling the activities of Checkwolf's third phase, from its mainstream recognition to its full integration.  Book 1 is a group of general stories: getting to know Checkwolf and their methods as they gain mainstream recognition, watching them learn and adapt to new situations.",

               "description": "The common wisdom is that the men who have attacked American Presidents - Czolgosz, Guiteau, Fromme, Hinckley, Moore, Oswald, Zangara - were disgruntled, disturbed loners. That wisdom includes John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of Abraham Lincoln, called a failed actor and a madman.\r\n\r\nBut the truth is that Wilkes was the matinee idol of his time; and the attack on Lincoln was not the act of a maniac, but a part of a plan developed at the highest levels of the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nIn \"Consider the Elephant,\" by Aram Schefrin, the story of Wilkes'\r\nlife and death is told by his brother, Edwin Booth, called \"Ned.\" Ned was the greatest Shakespearean actor of his age, as was their father Junius in his era; and their brother June was an actor, too, though less successful than his brothers. The story is soaked in the ambiance of life in the American theater in the mid nineteenth century, and full of rich characters. It lays out in detail the path Wilkes took to the top of the celebrity heap, his growing involvement with the Southern rebels and the development in Richmond of the plot to kidnap - and later assassinate - the Union President.",

               "description": "From the acclaimed author of Infected comes an epic and exhilarating story of humanity\u2019s secret battle against a horrific enemy.\r\n\r\nAcross America, a mysterious pathogen transforms ordinary people into raging killers, psychopaths driven by a terrifying, alien agenda. The human race fights back, yet after every battle the disease responds, adapts, using sophisticated strategies and brilliant ruses to fool its pursuers. The only possible explanation: the epidemic is driven not by evolution but by some malevolent intelligence.\r\n\r\nStanding against this unimaginable threat is a small group, assembled under the strictest secrecy. Their best weapon is hulking former football star Perry Dawsey, left psychologically shattered by his own struggles with this terrible enemy, who possesses an unexplainable ability to locate the disease\u2019s hosts. Violent and unpredictable, Perry is both the nation\u2019s best hope and a terrifying liability. Hardened CIA veteran Dew Phillips must somehow forge a connection with him if they\u2019re going to stand a chance against this maddeningly adaptable opponent. Alongside them is Margaret Montoya, a brilliant epidemiologist who fights for a cure even as she reels under the weight of endless horrors.\r\n\r\nThese three and their team have kept humanity in the game, but that\u2019s not good enough anymore, not when the disease turns contagious, triggering a fast countdown to Armageddon. Meanwhile, other enemies join the battle, and a new threat \u2014 one that comes from a most unexpected source \u2014 may ultimately prove the most dangerous of all.\r\n\r\nCatapulting the reader into a world where humanity\u2019s life span is measured in hours and the president\u2019s finger hovers over the nuclear button, rising star Scott Sigler takes us on a breathtaking, hyper-adrenalized ride filled with terror and jaw-dropping action.

Against the wise advice of her best friend, Lupe, she makes a pre-meditated decision to seduce, tag and bag her newest boss---Wayne Hayter; the cool and always collected thirty-something, corporate-loving, sports-car-driving, designer duds wearing, General Manager of the Porsche dealership where Ceil merely tolerates her 9 to 5 gig.\r\n\r\nBut when a deliciously cute, mysterious and vaguely wild-eyed musician by the name of Mason Philips begins to crop up almost daily in and around the parking lot adjacent to her job just to chat---Ceil is intrigued---though he is just 'another loser in a garage band'. Suddenly, the stoic and unruffled Wayne Hayter has some serious competition to contend with almost before his flirtation with Ceil manages to get off the ground. But Mason Phillips---with his cheerful positive outlook, pit bull-like tenacity and an unwillingness to hear the word 'no'--- has a couple of tricks up his sleeve to keep the ball in his court. By the end, Ceil's only wish is to keep her hair from turning white before she has a chance to choose between her two dream suitors.",

               "description": "Some places are far darker than deep space.  Places where the shadows smile.   Where men go mad and lovers go missing.  These stygian corners of existence are where reality is stretched thin and something hungry is waiting just outside the corner of your eye.\r\n\r\nTurn out the lights, take a deep breath, and dare to visit one of these places.\r\n\r\nCrescent is dark science fiction at it's most visceral.  Phil Rossi weaves a tale that is reminiscent of old school Stephen King but with a shiny, new set of tricks and an appetite to terrify.   There's sex. There's corruption. There's horror.  And after you sweat your way through the first chapter, there's plenty more to keep you awake at night.\r\n\r\nCrescent features an original soundtrack written and performed by the author. \r\n\r\n\"... what is right now, my addiction -- Crescent. I'm waiting to see what happens with the freakin' story.  *I* do this to people, other people don't do this to me!\" -- Scott Sigler, author of Infested (Infection), Earthcore, and Ancestor.\r\n\r\n\"If you're debating about subscribing to Crescent, I've got one question: Why are you hesitating?  Just push the button that says \"Subscribe\" and hold on.  This podcast is part Babylon 5, part Firefly, and part Blade Runner... only darker.\"  -- Tee Morris, Author of Morevi, Billibub Baddings and the Case of the Singing Sword, and co-author of Podcasting for Dummies.\r\n\r\n\"The writing is great, the reading is first class; the production - the use of atmospheric music and ambient sound like crowd noise is really effective.\" -- Mike Bennett, author of One Among the Sleepless.

               "description": "Enter the world of Karen Marie Moning's New York Times bestselling Fever series with her first ever audiobook podcast, Darkfever. MacKayla Lane's life is good. She has great friends, a decent job, and a car that breaks down only every other week or so. In other words, she's your perfectly ordinary twenty-first-century woman. Or so she thinks...until something extraordinary happens.\r\n\r\nWhen her sister is murdered, leaving a single clue to her death-a cryptic message on Mac's cell phone-Mac journeys to Ireland in search of answers. The quest to find her sister's killer draws her into a shadowy realm where nothing is as it seems, where good and evil wear the same treacherously seductive mask. She is soon faced with an even greater challenge: staying alive long enough to learn how to handle a power she had no idea she possessed-a gift that allows her to see beyond the world of man, into the dangerous realm of the Fae....\r\n\r\nAs Mac delves deeper into the mystery of her sister's death, her every move is shadowed by the dark, mysterious Jericho, a man with no past and only mockery for a future. As she begins to close in on the truth, the ruthless Vlane-an alpha Fae who makes sex an addiction for human women-closes in on her. And as the boundary between worlds begins to crumble, Mac's true mission becomes clear: find the elusive Sinsar Dubh before someone else claims the all-powerful Dark Book-because whoever gets to it first holds nothing less than complete control of the very fabric of both worlds in their hands....",

And you don't have to take our word for it: some world-class physicists think so too:\r\n\r\n\"Bill got the vast majority of the physics right, which is highly unusual -- especially in a book that is such a good read.\"\r\n-- Kip Thorne, Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics, California Institute of Technology and author of Black Holes and Time Warps: Einstein's Outrageous Legacy\r\n\r\n\"Singularity is an uncommonly good science thriller, quite free of the poetic license some writers take with the laws of nature in order to put together the yarn.\"\r\n-- Jacob D. Bekenstein, Professor of Theoretical Physics, Hebrew University, Jerusalem and discoverer of black-hole entropy\r\n\r\n\"As a specialist in black hole astrophysics, I would have to say that this is one of the most creative uses of primordial black-hole theory in science fiction.\"\r\n-- Scott A. Hughes, Professor of Theoretical Astrophysics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology\r\n\r\nNow, for the first time, the real-life counterpart of Singularity's resident cosmologist, Doctor Jack Adler, steps up to explain what it is all these scientists are raving about, in his \"Soapbox Seminars\" -- an informal look at the hard-core science behind the novel.\r\n\r\nPS: Doctor Jack's got about fifteen or so of these seminars planned out so far, but that's subject to change -- and you could change it. If you've got a question about the science behind Singularity, send it to Jack at doctorjack at soapboxseminars.com. Jack will incorporate some of your questions into upcoming Seminars, and the all-time best question will win a hardcover copy of  Singularity, signed by the author, Bill DeSmedt.",

Seizing the opportunity to release his frustrations in his French teacher's nightly writing assignment, Peter shares Dorothea's story with his teacher, imagining a world in which a coven of witches, a renegade elf lord and the humans have joined forces to conquer the elvish forest. \r\n\r\nWith the Bois d'or on the verge of being invaded, Dorothea and her friends embark on a quest to find the wizard Mohan who will help them save their homeland. But the witches have other plans. They have set the three ancient evils of Anger, Fear and Lust against Dorothea. Can Dorothea survive the three curses and find Mohan in time to save her homeland? Dorothea's fate is in Peter's hands, but as his mother's marriage deteriorates and his infatuation with his French teacher increases, he must find a way to rise above the insanity and save not only Dorothea's home but also his own.",

A billion-dollar find, it waits for any company that can drill a world's record, three-mile-deep mine shaft.\r\n\r\nEarthCore is the company with the technology, the resources and the guts to go after the mother lode. Young executive Connell Kirkland is the company's driving force, pushing himself and those around him to uncover the massive treasure.\r\n\r\nBut Kirkland and EarthCore are not the first to find this treasure. The mountain's history reveals two centuries of disappearances, murder, and insanity.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of ancient platinum knives, razor-sharp despite lying untouched for 1,000 years, reveals evidence of an ancient culture. If the artifacts are genuine, they show a pre-historic empire that once spanned from the Southern tip of South America all the way up through the American Southwest.\r\n\r\nWealth and fame lie under that Utah mountain, but at three miles below the surface, where the rocks are so hot they burn bare skin, something has been waiting for centuries. Waiting ... and guarding. Kirkland and EarthCore are about to find out first-hand why this treasure has never been unearthed.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://technorati.com/claim/4b4hrzqp6\" rel=\"me\">Technorati Profile</a>",

He's doing the best work of his career and can guarantee that the system will be, without question, the most counterintuitive, user-hostile piece of software ever pushed forth into the world.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because Art is an industrial saboteur. He may live in London and work for an EU telecommunications megacorp, but Art's real home is the Eastern Standard Tribe.\r\n\r\nThe comm -- instant wireless communication -- puts everyone in touch with everyone else, twenty-four hours a day. But one thing hasn't changed: the need for sleep. The world is slowly splintering into Tribes held together by common time zones, less than families and more than nations. And Art is working to humiliate the Greenwich Mean Tribe to the benefit of his own people.\r\n\r\nThe world of next week is overflowing with ubiquitous computing, where an idea scribbled onto one's comm can revolutionize an industry. But in a world without boundaries, nothing can be taken for granted -- not happiness, not money, and, most certainly, not love.\r\n\r\nWhich might explain why Art finds himself stranded on the roof of an insane asylum outside Boston, debating whether to push a pencil into his brain. Happiness or smarts? What's it going to be, Art?",

Won't commit to anything until it's everything.\r\n\r\nLondon, however, has other ideas.\r\n\r\nWhen a virtual stranger calls Aston a few hours before his death, fate catches up with him, derailing his barely-made plans.

               "description": "Canyon Park is bowed down under a relentless torrent of rain. The fields are flooded, the bridges crumble and the increasingly isolated town is host to a serial killer with a grudge against the wealthy Lollo family. Slipping between a small cast of characters; the killer, the tortured policeman hiding a dark secret, the returning son, the inquisitive librarian, the boy caught between cultures.... each of these marred, struggling humans a part of the threadbare fabric of the town. Throughout the story, secrets and motivations are slowly revealed, people continue to die, and it continues to rain. - \r\n\r\n<i><a href=\"http://podpeep.blogspot.com/\">Emily from POD People</a></i>\r\n\r\nThe story is about a Native American, driven to madness by his experience growing up in the small upstate New York town of Canyon Park being discriminated, molested and ostracized. In his mind, various characters of his tribe's mythology and American popular culture vie for his soul. He terrorizes the residents of Canyon Park, murdering those he judges guilty, to punish them for their crimes against him and his ancestors. Strangely, since the killing spree began, there has been a deluge of constant rain adding to the dismal mood and hampering efforts to stop him while the resident also battle nature's fury. Under these conditions, various characters gather from places as close as the local library, to as far away as New York City, to absolve their sins and stop their beloved town from being eroded away.\r\n\r\nAll the characters are eventually stripped bare in this trying time and face their naked souls, their dark inner parts that they are afraid to see and their true selves. America's national guilt over the destruction of the Native American culture is weaved through the motivation of the characters as they struggle with the consequences of acts they committed in the past or the acts of their kin.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Boarding Schools and the Mythology of Iroquois Creation Myth were thoroughly researched and are based on fact though the setting and characters are all fictional. \r\n\r\n<i>Erosion</i> by Lon S. Cohen is <a href=\"http://www.lulu.com/content/254522\">available in paperback from Lulu.com.</a>\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/tomcote\">Tom Cote</a> for his version of Amazing Grace in my last chapter. <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/tomcote\">Check out his music here.</a>",

               "description": "There is something in the jungle of Irma Flores that has terrorized Sarah for years.  As a scientist she needs to know what it is and by confronting this evil she is about to be awakened from her nightmare. She doesn\u2019t know it but she will also begin her first faltering steps toward enlightenment.  Along the way, she will have to contend with a strange dwarf people, pirates, corporate raiders and an obstinate lover.  Her road to nirvana will be a raw and bruising journey that is certain to be both entertaining and moving for the listener.\r\n\r\nThe media eagerly made the startling announcement about the unique hobbit fossil find and the existence of hobbit human relatives on Flores Island 16,000 years ago, prehistoric survivors that seemingly went extinct just a few short years ago.  Only, the scientists were dead wrong! They are still alive today and two American scientists are going to discover them and unwittingly they will introduce this tribe of small, archaic people to the ultimate modern predator: humanity.\r\n\r\nThese three-foot tall bipeds are not the Hobbits of the JRR Tolkien's stories, but a small tribe of dwarf prehistoric people, Homo Floresiensis, living in seeming isolation for nearly a half million years on the Indonesian tropical island of Irma Flores.  In their unrelenting quest for knowledge, Sarah and Richard inadvertently expose these innocents to the onslaught of the modern world including corporate raiders, Indonesian pirates and ardent religious zealots. In the process of discovery and befriending these ancient people, Sarah and Richard must survive a serious clash of divergent personalities while rediscovering their own humanity and need for love. This is their adventure, combining a clash of cultures, religious ardor with the oldest stories of all: the meaning of friendship and true love.\r\n\r\nThis as a rousing, humorous adventure novel with serious undertones about our very definition of humanity, and how we treat the other sentient creatures that share our small planet.  Many elements within the novel have a strong connection with the topical issues of today ranging from Creationism, the environment, stem cell research and finally to the voracious appetite of our ever expanding consumer economy.  Moreover, the so-called Hobbit people described within the novel, locally known by Flores natives as the Ebu Gogo, are being searched for by scientists in Indonesia as we speak.  This story is so gripping that both \"Sixty Minutes\" on CBS and National Geographic ran numerous specials on the controversial Flores Island fossil find.\r\n\r\nThe Children God Forgot is the first novel in the Flores Girl Trilogy and the second novel is nearing completion!\r\n\r\nWarning: this adventure novel contains adult themes, numerous naked hobbits, some sexuality, adult language, a dose of graphic violence and a complete disdain for most authority figures.",

They practice an animistic religion which invests godlike qualities in animals such as the fox and the bear, and in certain features of the landscape. They believe that the sun (male) and the earth (female) mated to make a son, who then found a bride and fathered human beings.  The earth and sun share our daily experience of living, as do all plant and animal creatures. \r\n\r\nThis form of dynamic interdependence has been expressed over time in a wealth of songs and stories told by Sami shamans and wizards.  The stories are characterized by great reverence for our natural environment, which can form a strong spiritual foundation for sustainable living.  A selection of these stories is now for the first time adapted into modern English verse, written and voiced by Jabez L. Van Cleef.\r\n\r\nJabez L. Van Cleef, who also wrote \"All Is Beautiful:  The Navajo Creation Story\" for Podiobooks.com, has written poetic versions of spiritual texts from all of the world's great religious traditions.  His voice in dramatic readings explores the fine distinctions between metered prose and music, by creating a spoken word sound environment that lulls the listener into a state of profound receptivity.",

               "description": "High fashion, corporate malfeasance, celebrity culture, and an obsessed media collide with exuberant violence and volatile intensity in Grey, the explosive debut novel by Jon Armstrong.\r\n\r\nFor Michael Rivers, life is perfect. Michael has everything; tall, handsome, and famous, he is worshipped by billions of fans around the globe. He is wealthy beyond measure, the heir apparent to RiverGroup, one of the handful of high-tech corporations that controls the world. He is fashionable, setting trends with his wardrobe of immaculate designer suits, each a unique and celebrated work of art. And Michael is in love, perfect love, sharing a private language based entirely on quotes from the latest fashion magazine advertisements, with Nora, his beautiful, witty, and equally perfect fiance, the only woman with whom he can see surgically-altered monochromatic eye to eye.\r\n\r\nWhen an assassin's bullets pierce Michael's body before the unblinking eyes of cameras, reporters, and viewers at a press junket, everything changes, forcing Michael to question everything about his previously perfect world. Illusions shattered and forcibly separated from Nora, Michael seeks to uncover the reasons behind the attempted assassination, embarking on a quest that leads him to question his relationships with his loud, profane, and narcissistically Ultra father; his estranged mother; and the perilous, contaminated, neo-feudalistic world that lies beyond the safe and protected bubble of corporate family life.\r\n\r\nMichael must delve deep into his past, finding that all paths he uncovers seem to lead to the now-closed PartyHaus, and to a time when he was the golden boy, dancing furiously to the beat of notorious all-night Rage parties thrown by his father.\r\n\r\nGrey was published by NightShade Books in February 2007.\r\n\r\n\"Grey is a legendary book waiting to happen. It's a mad, stylish, trippy, endlessly inventive romp through the biohazardous wastes of post-genre literature. Jon Armstrong is a genius, with an umlaut, to the fifth power.\"\r\n-- Michael Chabon, author of The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay and The Wonder Boys.\r\n\r\n\"A dazzling trip through a world alternately glamorous and grimy, set in a crumbling but media-saturated future, with eyeball-kicks galore.\" --Locus Magazine\r\n\r\n\"If you enjoy or, better yet, prefer a more literary than commercial read and you can appreciate a satirical stab at not only the fashionable elite of entertainment but a subtle yet obvious social comment on the general public and its destructive nature, then give Grey a read; it will not disappoint you.\" -- Book Opinions ",

               "description": "The humans of Soldara generally view the elves of Alasiri through a prism of superstition and hate; nevertheless, in the borderlands, both races have quietly intermingled for centuries. Those of mixed blood, however, are the victims of bigotry and scorned as inferior in Soldaran society.\r\n\r\nSeventeen year old Jelena, of human and elven blood, has spent her entire life as an outcast in Amsara Castle. Her mother, the sister of the Duke of Amsara, died giving birth to her, leaving Jelena to be raised by her foster mother Claudia in the servants' hall, denied her proper place in the family by her uncle. Though her life is hard, Jelena has managed to adapt to her circumstances. Her fragile peace is shattered when she discovers she has a mysterious and frightening new ability that manifests itself as a powerful blast of blue energy. Convinced the energy is a form of magic inherent in her elven blood, Jelena desperately wants to learn the nature of her ability, and how to control it. She knows the only people who can teach her about elven magic are the elves themselves.\r\n\r\nWhen the Duke announces his intention of selling her as a concubine, Jelena decides to flee Amsara forever. Claudia gives Jelena an extraordinary gift \u2013 a clue to her elven father's identity in the form of a signet ring. As Jelena's mother lay dying, she had given the ring to Claudia, charging her with keeping it safe and seeing that her daughter received the ring when she was old enough to understand its meaning.\r\n\r\nWith the ring as her only link to her unknown father, Jelena sets off north, her cousin Magnes by her side. The two cousins make it to the border, but are ambushed by bandits near the bank of a river. Just as the bandits are closing in for the kill, a mounted elven patrol sweeps down upon them. The leader of the elven patrol is Ashinji Sakehera, a young man unhappily constrained by the dictates of a society as tradition-bound and hierarchical as its Soldaran counterpart. Ashinji has been troubled by a dream, one in which a half-elven girl cries out to him for help, only to be swallowed up by a mysterious force of unspeakable menace. He has no idea what the dream means, but he will soon find out its significance as he rushes headlong into a stunning confrontation at the river's edge.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, an ancient entity, imprisoned and unconscious for a millennium, has at long last awakened. Implacably evil, its lust for revenge upon those who stripped it of power and exiled it to the eternal dark is second only to its desire to reclaim the key to its lost magic, a magic that will allow it to escape its prison and destroy, then remake, the material world to suit its own purpose. The entity with no name knows the magical key resides within a vessel, a living being that carries the energy in the form of a blue fire...\r\n\r\nGriffin's Daughter is the story of a young woman's struggle to find her place in the world, a young man's search for his life's purpose, and the strength of true love.",

They\u2019re doing it to defend the new nation, says the revolutionary government \u2013 defend it from the sorcerers and sorceresses who used to be the lackeys of the man-eating Auks in the bad old days of the monarcy.  When Grizelda, a young seamstress from the poorer part of the capitol city, suddenly finds herself the government\u2019s target, she fears she is done for.\r\n\r\nBut in prison she meets a group of rat-riding pixies and earns their undying friendship by mending their clothes.  In exchange, they help her to escape and seek refuge in the world below the city.  Living underground means Grizelda has to adapt to the strange customs of the goblins, a cheerless bunch who storm around muttering about the dictatorship of the proletariat.  \r\n\r\nNot content to remain in exile, Grizelda winds up entangled with a group of human revolutionaries.  Together they hatch a daring plan to return the Republic to its original ideals, before it decayed into a police state.

Following a hostile takeover attempt, Lazard is found dead in his office of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound.\r\n\r\nAuthor Tom Evslin, a serial CEO, also took a company public in the Internet bubble and fought off hostile takeover attempts in the subsequent rubble. Unlike Larry, Evslin lived to tell what may be the definitive story of those strange times.\r\n\r\nThe mystery moves backwards and forwards around the time of Larry's death. Sex, power, money, farce, and tragedy mix in boardrooms and bedrooms, the parties of the World Economic Forum in Davos, and the smoky stairway of the South Tower of the World Trade Center.\r\n\r\nhackoff.com - not a porn site - provides anti-hacker protection for e-commerce. Larry Lazard started the business after his release from prison to which he was sentenced for a confessed hacker attack on banks.\r\n\r\nThe folks at hackoff track the company's stock price with fatal fascination; an online chat board provides a Greek chorus of contradictory explanations and expectations; analysts spin golden fantasies from websites and eyeballs; traders conjure real fortunes at their trading desks; and everyone who can clamors for \"friends and family\" stock.\r\n\r\nhackoff.com's characters include CFO Donna Langhorne, Larry's ex-lover and classmate from Harvard Business School and a former swimsuit model; Chief Technical Officer Dom Montain, who dropped out of Caltech to write video games; Detective Mark Cohen, NYPD, who's investigating Larry's death; Larry's wife Louise, who is certain her husband was murdered; and Ahmed Qali, who represents a group of Palestinian programmers in Jenin to which hackoff out-sources work. Along with the bankers, CEOs, and CFOs of dotcom America, are eavesdropping limo drivers and waiters, venture capitalists, hackers, terrorists, and the victims and heroes of 9/11.\r\n\r\nIf you've ever wanted to be a fly on the wall of the boardrooms, private jets, and ornate meeting rooms of brokerage firms, hackoff.com gives you your chance. You'll be better prepared for the next bubble if you read this book but that's not why you'll eagerly download each online episode. You'll do that because the cleverly woven mystery will have you dying to know whodunit.",

               "description": "Thirteenth-century Japan is a dangerous place, even in a time of peace.  Capricious gods, shape-changing animals, and bloodthirsty demons are as real and unpleasant as a gang of vicious bandits.  From the wilderness emerges a young, idealistic warrior with his father\u2019s mysterious sword on his hip, a wise, sarcastic dog at his side, and a yearning in his heart to find a worthy master.  He dreams only of being samurai. Little does he suspect the agony and glory that await him when his dreams come true.\r\n\r\nFinding a master should be easy for a warrior as skilled as Ken\u2019ishi, but the generations-long wars for the Imperial throne have ended.  The land has settled into an uneasy peace and cast multitudes of proud, powerful warriors to the four winds.  The new peace means that these masterless warriors, ronin, often must stoop to crime and banditry to feed themselves.  Ken\u2019ishi finds himself plagued by the hatred and mistrust of peasants and samurai alike.\r\n\r\nWhen he saves a noble maiden from a pack of bandits, he and his faithful dog become enmeshed in the intrigues of samurai lords, vengeful constables, Mongol spies, and a shadowy underworld crime boss known as Green Tiger.  But Ken\u2019ishi has a few secret weapons of his own, granted to him by his mysterious past and his magical upbringing.  If only he knew more about his mysterious past, his parents\u2019 murder, and the sword that seems to want to talk to him. . . .\r\n\r\nHeart of the Ronin is an action-packed historical fantasy, set against the backdrop of ancient intrigue and impending war, the first of a sweeping three-part epic filled with deadly duels and climactic battles.  Creatures of folklore and myth are as real as the katana in one\u2019s hand.  And just as deadly.\r\n\r\n\"A fusion of historical fiction and adventure fantasy, the first volume of Heermann's Ronin Trilogy is a page-turning folkloric narrative of epic proportions. In a strange, supernatural feudal Japan, 17-year-old warrior Ken'ishi, a masterless samurai with a mysterious past and a legendary sword, saves the life of Kazuko, a powerful lord's daughter. Soon he becomes entangled in a deadly web of treachery, obsession and vengeance along with a bevy of conspirators, spies, assassins and otherworldly monstrosities. Though Heermann does little to push the boundaries of the subgenre, his writing style is confident and fluid, his characters are well developed and his serpentine story line anything but predictable. Numerous tantalizingly unresolved plot threads will have readers anxiously awaiting the second installment in this gripping tale of ill-fated love, betrayal and destiny. \" - PUBLISHERS WEEKLY\r\n\r\n\"Heart of a Ronin is a solid, likeable adventure story, sure to please fans of Japanese culture, and fantasy readers alike.\" - ADVENTURES IN SCI-FI PUBLISHING",

               "description": "Part film noir detective story, part fantasy adventure, part East End gangster tale, How to Disappear Completely concerns Theo Braithwaite, a failed actress and worse waitress, becoming involved in an unseen world populated by history's rejects and runaways from a secret society known as The Footmen. A stranger to London, waiting for life to come and find her, she is instead found by a part-time thief called Kilbey Salmon who, along with his rockabilly-obsessed partner, is attempting to eke out a living stealing things that have already been stolen and finding people who don't want to be found.\r\n\r\nAn episodic narrative, Kilbey and Nero's capers will drag Theo through the forgotten parts and people of London, hunted by ancient sects, carnivorous shadows, cannibalistic butchers and off-duty policemen. Along the way she'll meet the Eternal Footmen, blow up Hammersmith Bridge, reach the end of history and quite possibly disappear completely.\r\n\r\nIf Theo is to survive, she'll need to get her life sorted before all of our futures catch up with her.",

(Kind of like Arthur Anderson for Lex Luthor.) As far as possible, he practices an honest trade, but his clients are  so egomaniacal that they don't listen to his advice. \r\n\r\nFrustrated, Edwin decides to go into the evil business for himself. Alternately  dark and funny, this is a satire on corporate culture as well as the traditional comic book villain. ",

As told by the author,  I Sold the Moon! explores how a young man, fresh out of college, could get the idea that he could claim the moon, and then sell it.  Exactly what drugs was he on?   Well??..\r\n\r\nMoon Man's adventures are paralleled throughout by a more earthly concern: his romance with a young woman as adventurous as he, in the turbulent days of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll.   The story of this \"first love\" is threaded from the opening chapter until the final page.  I Sold The Moon! is for anyone who believes in following their dreams and searching for true love.  It's cosmic, perceptive, passionate and fun.  Mostly fun.  Hear it here from the one, the only, the original Moon Man.",

Sent there by Kennedy Lacombe, the richest man in the world, their only task is to find ways to mine the asteroid as efficiently as possible. John, however, has grandiose plans including riding a comet around the sun to obtain enough water for the colony to one day survive independent from Earth. His ambition quickly shifts when he discovers an accident with the station's birth control pills causes 20 women, including Jennifer, the woman he loves, to become pregnant. The rules on pregnancy are simple; a baby is a drain on resources and must be removed. John, his friends, and a large group of miners will do anything they can to prevent that, including declaring themselves the first independent colony outside of Earth.",

               "description": "A collection of Short Stories by action author Basil Sands. \r\n\r\nThese stories will get your heart racing in thirty minutes or less as you plummet to the depths of human emotion and the desire to protect what is dearest when all hell breaks loose and there is no one there to do anything about it but an Average Joe...or an almost Average Joe.  Think of each episode as something like the Twilight Zone, with guns, knives, and whatever the hero can find to defend themselves and their families from the bad guys.  These are Basil's original action novels taken down to single episode bite size chunks that'll get your blood pressure up on the commute to the office, or while on the treadmill at the gym. \r\n\r\nFrom a former Navy Seal, to a dad trying to make things right for his son, to a bunch of twenty something adventurers high on an Alaskan mountain you'll get the hardcore action you crave.  Twice a month, delivered right to your MP3 player.\r\n\r\nYou want action?  You want pulse pounding excitement?  You want to see the bad guys get their due? \r\n\r\nHere it is in a way that only a guy named Basil can do.\r\n\r\nSo make sure to put your tray table in the upright and locked position, and fasten your seat belt... it's going to be a wild ride.",

               "description": "Infamy is a difficult thing to live with. It removes privacy, infects every aspect of daily life, and even causes the people it encounters casually to run and hide. Very few know how to deal with it well, but others can make the infamous lifestyle an art form.\r\n\r\nJoin a university professor as he overcomes a slight brush with infamy, grabs life by the horns, and takes charge of his once fearful existence. Join a successful executive as he regains a life lost to an infamous woman. And join a graduate student researching the length and breadth of what infamy can do to a soul. \r\n\r\nThis is a story of three men grappling with the ingloriousness of human existence. Throw in a little adventure, stir up a little romance, and add a mythical trip to the afterlife, and you will have \"Infamy,\" the first podiobook by Squid Varilekova.

               "description": "Across America a mysterious disease is turning ordinary people into raving, paranoid murderers who inflict brutal horrors on strangers, themselves, and even their own families.\r\n\r\nWorking under the government's shroud of secrecy, CIA operative Dew Phillips crisscrosses the country trying in vain to capture a live victim. With only decomposing corpses for clues, CDC epidemiologist Margaret Montoya races to analyze the science behind this deadly contagion. She discovers that these killers all have one thing in common - they've been contaminated by a bioengineered parasite, shaped by a complexity far beyond the limits of known science.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Perry Dawsey - a hulking former football star now resigned to life as a cubicle-bound desk jockey - awakens one morning to find several mysterious welts growing on his body. Soon Perry finds himself acting and thinking strangely, hearing voices . . . he is infected.\r\n\r\nThe fate of the human race may well depend on the bloody war Perry must wage with his own body, because the parasites want something from him, something that goes beyond mere murder.\r\n\r\nInfected is the first major print release from Internet phenom Scott Sigler, whose podcast-only audiobooks have drawn an immense cult following, with more than three million individual episodes downloaded. Now Sigler storms the bookstore shelves with this cinematic, relentlessly paced novel that mixes and matches genres, combining horror, technothriller, and suspense in a heady mix that is equal parts Chuck Palahniuk, Michael Crichton, and Stephen King.\r\n\r\nInfected will crawl beneath your skin and leave fresh blood on every page.\r\n\r\nQUOTES: \r\n\"Part Stephen King, part Chuck Palahniuk, Infected blends science fiction and horror into a pulpy masterpiece of action, terror, and suspense.  Three recommendations: don't read it at night, or just after you've eaten a full meal, or if you're weak of heart.  You've been warned!\"\r\n--James Rollins, New York Times bestselling author of The Judas Strain and Black Order\r\n\r\n\"Sigler is masterful at grabbing the reader by the throat and refusing to let go. Just when I thought I knew what abyss he was leading me across, he knocked the bridge out from under... I think I screamed the whole way down... Infected is a marvel of gonzo, in-your-face, up-to-the-minute terror.\"\r\n--Lincoln Child, New York Times bestselling author of Deep Storm and Death Match\r\n\r\n\"Sigler is the Richard Matheson of the 21st Century...smart and creepy, Infected is a flawless thinking-person's thriller. Bravo to a bold new talent!\"\r\n--Jonathan Maberry, Bram Stoker Award-winning author of Bad Moon Rising and Ghost Road Blues\r\n\r\n\"Horror mavens rejoice! Infected is a revelation -- a novel that lives up to its hype. From page one, the story of a mysterious smart-virus that turns its hosts into deadly drooling drones creeps up on a reader like the ratchet of a roller coaster climbing toward its inevitable crest. Sigler brings the folksy character detail of Stephen King, the conceptual panache of Clive Barker, and the oozing, shuddery pathologies of a David Cronenberg movie. Zombies, spies, conspiracies, and gallons of goo make this the fastest read in the west! Highest recommendation!\"\r\n-- Jay Bonansinga, national bestselling author of Shattered, Twisted, Frozen, and The Sinking of the Eastland\r\n\r\n\"Sigler has a unique talent for keeping readers on the edge of their seats; I absolutely had to know what was going to happen next. Infected is full of mayhem, action, and gore--and you won't be able to put it down.\"\r\n-- Dave Wellington, author of 13 Bullets and the Monster Island trilogy\r\n\r\n\"Scott Sigler's Infected is a bucking pulp pony that throws you this way and that, and just when you think you've got your balance, that ole pony bucks the other way. All in all, one hell of an exhilarating ride, and highly recommended.\"\r\n--Joe R. Lansdale, World Horror Convention Grand Master and six-time Bram Stoker Award-winning author of Bubba Ho-Tep and Lost Echoes",

               "description": "The Old Testament of the Bible contains many mysterious passages. In 1 Chronicles 4:9-10, we find a short prayer uttered by an obscure man:\r\n\r\n\"Jabez was more honorable than his brothers. His mother named him 'Jabez' saying, 'Because I bore him with pain.' Now, Jabez called on the God of Israel saying, 'Oh, Lord, bless me indeed and expand my territory. Keep Your hand on me, and keep evil from me, that I may not cause pain!' And God granted him what he requested.\"\r\n\r\nNothing is known about the man who voiced this heartfelt cry to God. He appears to be a man whose family was erased from Israel's history. But if the man and his family's memories were erased, why is he mentioned at all? And why does his prayer appear in a listing of the members of the tribe of Judah?\r\n\r\nIn \"Jabez: Conceived in Pain, Delivered in Victory\" we meet the man behind the prayer. We discover why his family could not be mentioned in the chronicles of the tribes. We learn why he was more honorable than his brothers.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, we find a man with whom many of us can identify. He is a man with a pitiful past and no hope for a future. He is a man who struggles to find meaning and significance in life. He is a man who is desperate to be accepted by his fellow man.\r\n\r\nBut most of all, he is a man who craves a relationship with God.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Jabez turns out to be more than an obscure man in a forgotten time. Instead, he is found to be a man whose prayer had a significant impact on the history of Israel. Though the story takes places over 3,000 years ago, its impact still affects us today.\r\n\r\nAnd it all started with the story of a life, told to one small boy.",

               "description": "This is a poignant and irreverent diary of the author's yearlong (2001-2) experience of teaching English to college students in Beijing, People's Republic of China.  From the very first pages, the author draws you into his struggle with a culture worlds away from his comfort zone.  The author's generous and compelling personality allowed him to gain access to the lives of his students and their families, who became characters in his tale. One can experience the author's wit and humanity throughout the narrative.\r\n\r\nThe author's humorous view of China is especially timely and dovetails with the current explosion of interest in that country as it enters the modern world.  The book is neither a travelogue nor a look at the government, although elements of those subjects are woven into the story.  Instead, it is an engaging look at China, tailored toward those who know little about it.  Still, those who have lived and/or traveled there will also enjoy the book as it reminds them of the absurdities they, too, experienced.",

               "description": "By turns hilarious and chilling, poet and novelist Michael Brownstein's latest novel MUST NOT SLEEP is a shamanic initiation into personal freedom -- political, emotional, and sexual -- which uncovers the secrets behind the destructive policies of those in positions of power. It's the story of Isaac, seemingly just a time-server in the system (he works \"at a mid-level position for a mid-sized company in midtown Manhattan\") whose programming is wiped clean as the result of a series of  \"big dreams\" during which he loses all fear of death.\r\n\r\nFilled with light, feeling invincible, Isaac encounters a woman similarly determined to erase her past who eagerly takes a new name for herself: Georgia. Together they enter a shamanic realm where limitations of time and space no longer apply and where the real forces behind the trashing of the planet soon reveal themselves.\r\n\r\nMUST NOT SLEEP answers these questions: Who or what is encouraging environmental meltdown and a state of perpetual war? Why does the current American administration engage in actions seeming to sabotage our future?  When Isaac realizes that something more than human greed must explain what's going on, another order of reality opens up. The demonic possession of our leading political figures shows itself in ways he and Georgia are barely able to withstand. But all is not lost: learning to use their innate powers, they are able to heal both themselves and the darkest figure of the present moment, \"the man with the frozen heart.\"\r\n\r\nMichael Brownstein's website (www.healingdick.com) contains related work including the new CD \"Healing Dick.\"\r\n           \r\n\"The first roll of the shaman's drum in fiction, this incendiary novel asks why wer'e pursuing policies on a global scale almost certain to result in our destruction. Who or what is responsible for this situation? Read MUST NOT SLEEP and find out.\"  -- John Perkins, author of CONFESSIONS OF AN ECONOMIC HIT MAN",

               "description": "In the nineteen-sixties, a group of wealthy men concludes that it's already too late to stop global warming from destroying the planet. But they have a plan to save themselves.\r\n\r\nTwenty years later, Jack Crowley and Jim Patterson stumble onto the conspiracy, and every answer they find is accompanied by more questions - and more deaths.\r\n\r\nJack is a former idealist, turned cynical by his years working as a New York tabloid editor. But his enthusiasm returns as he looks into the work of a NASA scientist who tells Jack about cover-ups at the space agency.  Jim is a detective with little patience for conspiracy nuts. But he hates loose ends, and is unable to let go of the inconsistencies in another suspicious NASA death.  Soon, his investigation leads him to Jack, and they join forces.\r\n\r\nAs Jack and Jim dig deeper, they are targeted by the type of killers that don't usually miss. From Washington to Las Vegas to the Middle East, they manage to stay one step ahead of their pursuers in a race to expose the truth, and maybe, just maybe, save the world.",

Before his victory, Lachlan was killed by his trusted friend, Allarun.  Now, Allarun is still in power but haunted by dreams of Lachlan's death curse: that Lachlan would return to avenge his death.  Allarun's decision is to destroy the very people Lachlan tried to unite. Only two men have the power to stop the slaughter.  Romarin, the last of a line of kings, and a half-blood mercenary named Shadowhelm.  One may be destined to be Lachlan, but can they unlock the secret to Lachlan's power before Allarun kills them?  \"Prophecy Of Swords is a remarkably rich fantasy that takes you into new realms of wonder and imagination.  The battles and magic portrayed here full of excitement and intrigue.  It's hard to find a good fantasy that isn't a rehash of all that has been done before, but Margaret H. Bonham has managed to break the mold and give readers something totally unique and different.  A guaranteed winner.\"  -- Laura J.

               "description": "When Raven comes to Redthwen to meet her mentor Orvannon, she encounters a vicious traveler, a hag with an extraordinary Voice of Command, and that hag's charge, a mysterious little girl. By the time Orvannon arrives, Raven will have learned too much about these strangers, and she will have discovered a dragon with the ability to put people into a swoon.\r\n\r\nOrvannon's instructions start Raven off on an epic adventure. She will master the greatest bit of nose-magic in all of her native Ausland. She will face the dragon in combat. And she will have to deal with the hag while totally under control of that woman's power. These adventures lead to more, as Raven discovers how the great city of Shelton is under attack. She must use all her persuasion to bring a powerful wizard to the city's aid, and she will find that facing up to the attacking army is not enough.\r\n\r\nRaven explores the magical caves created by three great wizards, eventually discovering the greatest evil of her time. Victory in the \"big boss battle\" is not enough. When the evil magic is destroyed, Raven and her friend must avoid starvation, and face the lightning bolts of yet another mage, to have a chance of staying alive in peace.\r\n\r\nRaven's Gift is set in a magical, pastoral medieval world. Raven has a strange ability that is as much a curse as a gift. Trouble follows her every step, and danger approaches at every turn. She begins her journey with only her wits and her nose, but though her past haunts her, she finds companions who help her make amends for a terrible mistake.\r\n\r\nRaven's Gift is a dramatic fantasy with an unusual heroine and intriguing magic. With Raven's deep bond to nature and her pragmatic attitude toward the obstacles in her path, she manages to find her place as destiny's unsung hero in her dangerous world.\r\n\r\nOne reader has said that Raven's Gift is like South Park mets James Bond meets Dungeons and Dragons. Although there's combat and even a military campaign in this novel, much of the action occurs in lively conversations. Even today, at the beginning of the 21st century, it is impossible to imagine making Raven's Gift into a movie -- for an unusual reason -- but if such a movie could be made, some parts of it might earn an R rating for being a bit earthy.",

And his experience as an Army correspondent in Vietnam (1970-71) offered clues to the demands a new generation of America's youth would face in the 21st century.  Route 66 to Vietnam:  A Draftee's Story traces the fate of Mark Landon and other children from Growing Up on Route 66 (an earlier novel in the Route 66 Novel Series) through Southeast Asia and on to prosperous--if troubled--times later in life.\r\n\r\n    Successful highway engineer Mark Landon is irritated by a sore tooth, by a rebellious teenage son, by a daughter's lack of interest in her promising athletic career, by his wife's apparent indifference to his needs, and by Ralph Banister, whose land is blocking the path of the highway Mark must build.  Beneath these everyday worries, however, memories of his time in Vietnam are stirring.  To survive a mid-life crisis, he begins to fear that he must not only confront the challenges of the present but also the ghosts of his wartime experiences.

It was a cautionary tale to remind everyone of what the damages of blind ambition can cause. Children would listen with their eyes wide open in terror as they imagined the wrath of God being unfurled upon the unwitting people who had dared to defy their own limitations. The programmers were powerful people that could control steel and wield vast creations at their fingertips, but when they discovered that humans were the result of complex programming and design, it was only natural that soon they would let their curiosity cause them to tamper. A new type of programmer was born, they were called geneticists.\r\n\r\nIt started off innocently; the programmers first decided that they would fix the inherent design flaws of their own programming. They understood the algorithms of what it meant to be human, but they weren't listening to the musical complexity in its entirety. Many people across the ancient world hailed the programmers of genetics and looked forward to ushering in a new era of humans that lacked flaws and defects. When parents wanted to have children they could pick out what kind of children they wanted, or even their pets or their food that they would consume.\r\n\r\nHumans were modified intrinsically so that they would be resistant to damage, grow stronger, and live longer. Within a hundred years there wasn't an aspect of civilization that wasn't altered by the geneticists and their tampering.\r\n\r\nBut during all of this modification that the geneticists accomplished they were all surprised when they realized that there was a flaw they had overlooked...\"\r\n\r\nNOTE: The author is donating all of his proceeds to the Family Literacy Foundation (http://www.read2kids.org).

Dating is the last thing on her mind when she accidentally bumps into Rob in an airport gift shop on Christmas day. Instant attraction draws them to one another, despite their different lifestyles. Looking as if he stepped out of a GQ ad, Rob exudes high class and money. Victoria is convinced he is too good for her, but Rob is immediately attracted to how she freely shares her innocently opinionated views. He likes her down to earth personality that is such a breath of fresh air compared to the gold digging socialites he is normally plagued with.\r\n\r\nIn this love story, Rob introduces Victoria to a high society world where she meets the rich and famous. For the first time she dares to believe her dream of becoming a singing star is possible through Rob\u2019s industry connections. However, Rob is different from anyone she has ever met and she fears she won\u2019t fit into his world. Her mother adds fuel to Victoria\u2019s misgivings by questioning Rob\u2019s intentions.

Join Rob and Victoria as they battle social class lines, parental disapproval and ghosts from their pasts to prove that their love is meant to last. \r\n\r\nMusic by Neil MacPherson.\r\n",

Branded a sociopath, she learns that even a free society isn't willing to grant freedom - or justice - to all.\r\n\r\nLibrary Journal says: <i>\"The author of the Arbiter Chronicles, an award-winning audio drama, vividly brings to life a cast of compelling characters while telling a story that measures the cost of freedom. The far-future military setting should appeal to fans of David Weber's \"Honor Harrington\" series as well as the military sf of David Drake.\"</i>",

It recounts the unlikely and amusing alliance between a 30-something burnt out, jaded political staffer, and an older, cantankerous, engineering professor. Driven by a federal election and the life of the resulting minority conservative government, the novel moves between the small town of Cumberland, Ontario on the shores of the Ottawa River, and the nation's capital. While the characters and their exploits are often comical, serious ideas on politics and democracy underlie the fun. For more information on the novel and author, visit www.terryfallis.com.",

               "description": "The Bloodbaths is the first book of Steve Libbey's new Aqua Pura Trilogy, a sword and sandal fantasy featuring a plumber on an epic quest to win back his beloved. Mercedes Lackey says: \"Steve Libbey gives the 'sword-and-sandal' epic a kick in the tunic and  propels it into the gestalt of the 21st century, with an everyman hero whose brains triumph over brawn.\"\r\n\r\nCrixus Oraan is a water artesan, an engineer who builds aqueducts and piping for bathhouses and mansions in the empire of Rond (which bears a resemblance to our own Roman Empire). His guild has entrusted him with a large sum of gold to establish a branch in the up-and-coming coastal town of Restia. In a misguided effort to win enough gold to buy a lavish house for his new fianc\u00e9 Kharrina, he loses the guild's gold in a card game.\r\n\r\nA shady sea captain present at the game\u2014and possibly responsible for fleecing him\u2014offers to sneak him off to the wild and mysterious continent of Minq. Afraid to lose his status in society for his crime, he agrees, hoping to gain back the gold he lost and compensate the guild back in Rond.\r\n\r\nIn this first volume in the bold new Aqua Pura Trilogy, Crixus finds employment with the Lamiae of Nistru, a cruel society where those at the top bathe in the lifeblood of those on the bottom. Will his conscience allow him to finish the job?\r\n\r\nBy turns dark, comedic, erotic and thrilling, The Bloodbaths is a book that transcends genre to stand on its own.\r\n\r\nThis podcast is read by SWC's own Veronica Giguere.",

The voice is hard enough for Clio to take; her mother, in her final illness, had lost touch with reality, and Clio fears the same fate. When the saint drags her unwilling into the past, to live the lives of people long dead, Clio fights to hold on to her reason. At the same time, in \"ordinary\" life, she starts to define--and have defined for her--a place in the life of the town. The resident mystic takes a liking to her; when she dies, she leaves everything to Clio. The sexton of the cathedral becomes a malevolent presence who threatens Clio at unforseen intervals. She falls in love with an Anglican priest on the cathedral staff, who is jealous of the very mystical experiences Clio struggles to deny.\r\n\r\nWhen the the past itself comes to life in Clio's present, in the person of a medieval plague victim who appears in her living room, Clio must choose between her rationalism and her compassion for the dying young man. Her decision lands her in a mental hospital, where she has to confront both the fear of losing her reason and the reality of her experiences.\r\n\r\nWhen Clio gains her release from the psychiatric ward, her psychiatrist, like many others, asks her to pray for him. As she re-enters the community, she finds that other people, whom she doesn't even know, have been taking care of the cottage left her by the mystic. When her employer is injured in an auto accident, Clio's half-believed prayers seem to lead to a miraculous healing.\r\n\r\nThroughout the story, past and present are shuffled like two halves of the same deck of cards. With each descent into history, Clio learns about other lives. With each return to the present, she has to make sense of her own life in light of what she's learned.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMUNION OF THE SAINT (the title is a paraphrase of a line from the Apostle's Creed) is a novel of past and present, skepticism and belief.\r\n\r\nThe story question: how does a modern, skeptical, rational person fit the irrational, the supernatural, into her life and still make some kind of sense of it all?\r\n\r\nThe answer: not easily.",

               "description": "This peculiar comic novel concerns two men and a woman and looks at how they came to be where they were when they met and the effect that meeting had upon them. \r\n\r\n\tOne man is Epitome Quirkstandard, a benighted aristocrat in the Wodehousian tradition whose staff have abandoned him to go and fight in the First World War and who discovers the taste for learning - especially when he attempts to make his own breakfast. \r\n\r\n\tThe other man is Mr. Crepuscular, a man who has written a multitude of educative pamphlets that he kindly rents out to Quirkstandard. As an illiterate scamp he ran away to join the circus, but through a series of unlikely adventures he ends up as a wise quasi-Buddhist who understands that sometimes the circus just isn't the right place to be.\r\n\r\n\tAnd the woman is Quirkstandard's aunt, Penelope Penultimate, a beautiful but severe lady of mature years who spent the majority of her life abroad taking parties of teenage girls on adventure holidays, with no insurance.\r\n\r\n\tThe story comes to a head when she issues an invitation to the men to come to her cottage in the country for the weekend. When they do so all manner of storylines come together, leading to unexpected revelations, arguments, jealousies, tensions, parlour games, picnics and nudity. Oh, it's so exciting.\r\n\r\n\tAlong the way the book is filled with historical and biographical asides as it covers the broad sweep of life from the sawdust circuses of the 1860s, through the Amazon Basin of the 1890s, right up to the ultra-modern trench-warfare of the 1910s. It is discursive and meandering in a way that makes it a particularly diminutive descendant of Tristram Shandy or Three Men In A Boat or something akin to Douglas Adams without the science-fiction. Some people like this sort of thing.\r\n\r\n\tThe author, A.F. Harrold, is a prize-winning performance poet, comedian and Englishman.  More can be discovered at <a href=\"http://www.afharrold.co.uk\">\r\nwww.afharrold.co.uk</a>. \r\n",

It first appeared, serialised in Punch magazine and might be regarded as the first 'blog'; being a record of the simplicities and humiliations in the life of this mundane, but upright, city clerk, who had an incontestable faith that a record of his daily life was worth preserving for posterity.\r\n\r\nSet in about 1891 in Holloway, which was then a typical suburb of the impecuniously respectable kind, the authors contrive a record of the manners, customs and experiences of the late Victorian era. The bare record of facts, simply recorded, manages to be humorous rather than dull, no doubt because of the usual occupations of the authors.\r\n\r\nGeorge Grossmith (1847-1912) was an actor and comedian.\r\n\r\nWeedon Grossmith (1852-1919) was an entertainer and illustrated the original work.\r\n(Summary by Martin Clifton) ",

Separated by much more than a river, one side is an unfinished technological marvel populated by mega-skyscrapers where the wealthy live, work, and play. The other is a forsaken wasteland where order is strictly maintained by a rogue group of cleric soldiers known as the street preachers. But this dichotomy is about to change. Slowly, quietly, clandestine forces are working to undermine the small piece of redemption the street preachers have brought to their concrete flocks. In the face of watching their second chance crumble to dust, some will fight to stop it. Others will kill to make it happen.\r\n\r\nA bold experiment in podcast fiction, The Failed Cities Monologues are told from the shifting perspectives of the characters who inhabit this world, twisted noir archetypes and cyberpunk warriors. Their lives and their stories are linked together by conspiracy, fate... and blood.",

Except Monson Grey is not Monson Grey.  At least, when he looks at himself in the mirror, the scarred face staring back is not someone he recognizes.  Now he finds himself attending an extraordinary school, the recipient of an incredible scholarship, among ridiculously rich classmates, and with no memory of how he got there or what to expect.  As bizarre events start to unfold around him, Monson wonders what secrets lay locked in his hidden past.  Add all this to a mysterious silver stone, an Indiana-Jones-copycat professor, Merlin the wizard, and even Atlantis, and you\u2019ll find yourself in a fantastic tale in which magic does exist and everything is never as it seems.",

This experience is just the beginning for Eve, a Los Angeles clinical hypnotherapist and researcher investigating whether reincarnation is fact or fiction.\r\n\r\nUnstoppable visions of an ancient lifetime steal days from her. The danger escalates when she wakes up physically injured and marked with a strange symbol. While Eve battles the past to maintain her sanity and safety, her project is jeopardized as another researcher's attempts to take over. One partner dies and another is accused of inappropriate conduct. Eve and her friend, Dr. Andrea McMurray, don't believe in coincidence and probe their shared visions for answers. \r\n\r\nOn the other side of the Atlantic, Welshman Ryerson Sanders is haunted by his dreams and believes Eve's research project can help him. For both of them, an ancient Celtic prophecy and long-sought revenge entangles the past with the present. A druidess and a shape-shifter must join to save the druid way of life, while a queen conspires to kill Erin's only high king. Will the oaths and agendas of the past reach across the centuries to strengthen or to destroy?",

She must travel through a mutant forest without becoming a sacrifice and into Rotted City, where toxic ruins hoard an ancient disease. To complicate matters, the man she loves accompanies her group.

               "description": "The Masnavi has been hailed by scholars as \"the greatest ever mystical poem\". Rumi threads together here entertaining stories with his mystical Sufi teachings, and passionate lyrical flights. His aim is to guide the listener along his detailed map of the mystic heart and its return journey to its divine origins. Book One provides the overall picture of the map, beginning with the reed torn from its reed-bed, and concluding with Ali's return above. Incredibly, Rumi achieves all of this using the simplest Persian language, everyday imagery and well-established stories, albeit with his own startling twists and innovations. No wonder he has even become the best-selling poet in the English language in the last decade.\r\n\r\nRumi's poetry is celebrated for its musicality. This translation, the Oxford World's Classics edition of which was awarded the 2004 Lois Roth Prize, follows the Persian original by using rhyming couplets. Toure Moumouni and Alain Kersanty perform Rumi's favourite musical instruments, the ney, the robab, the tar, and the daf, to give you a complete and authentic listening experience.\r\n\r\nDonations received by the author will be given appropriately to a Persian Sufi charity, to help it maintain its clinics for the most needy citizens of several West African nations.",

How would it be thwarted? \r\n\r\n\"The Onion Files\" is a spy thriller differing from all previous novels in one very important aspect: author Val Pattee was one of the Western world's top spy masters.

The title refers to an ingenious and diabolical plot by al&#8209;Qaeda to devastate vast areas of the United States soon after the 9/11 attacks. Pattee introduces readers to protagonists Jim and Mark Buchan, who work with the US Central Intelligence Agency and Russian counter-terrorism units in a fast-paced hunt across three continents to halt a computer virus and its brilliant creator.",

The influence of new, temporally-bound ideas on succeeding generations is revealed in a continuous discourse.\r\n\r\nThe physical idea of a palimpsest (writing over the top of an existing text in a manuscript) is here extended to an aural experience.  When the texts are read aloud, one over the top of another, the sound preserves some part of the utterance of each original, while concealing some part of the others. Just as the mind of a reader would struggle to decipher what is underneath a superimposed handwriting, the ear of the listener works harder to discern the meaning of the intentionally obscured speech.\r\n\r\nThe author has adapted prose source materials into a common format by paraphrasing the text into metered lines (iambic pentameter).  In a process called text weaving he creates a long poem in which the successive lines are bound rhythmically, but not always by meaning. In each stanza of the printed book, the first line is from Thoreau, the second line from Gandhi, and the third line from King.",

Aliens play positions based on physiology, creating receivers that jump 25 feet into the air, linemen that bench-press 1,200 pounds, and linebackers that -- literally -- want to eat you.

               "description": "This tale concerns a lad of twelve, who sets off unwillingly on a journey with his uncle. In the course of his adventures, he obtains a stone, whose ultimate meaning is tied up with the fate of a war between two cities. As commonly happens with boys, he finds himself at the center of the conflict. Can he divine the stone\u2019s purpose in time? Even more importantly, can he even hang on  to it?\r\n\r\nThe story includes a mystery, long journeys, prisons, adventure, and living out-of-doors.  There is also a fairly large battle at the end, with plenty of blood.  Death appears throughout.  I believe that no one washes his hands at any point in the account, but sometimes my memory is faulty. It takes place long ago, but not in a place you'll find in an atlas. Some may be disappointed in the absence of wizards and dragons.\r\n\r\nGirls are welcome to listen, but they should be forewarned.  Horses are mentioned, but no person develops any meaningful friendship with one.  Talking animals, while interesting, do not figure in any way (unless one considers boys between the ages of ten and fourteen to be talking animals).  There is absolutely no kissing of any kind. \r\n\r\nWith those cautions in mind, I invite you to listen to The Round Red Stone.",

Yet sixty years later, the world still suffers from war, greed and madness. Worse, man's nadir of systematic cruelty returns with bizarre new weapons. The metahumans of Earth must find a way to defeat this powerful foe and discover what lurks behind the scenes - a secret world hidden from our own. Mercedes Lackey, one of fantasy's most beloved voices, and new talent Steve Libbey bring you a podcast series that catapults the classic superhero into the 21st century.\r\n\r\nBook One: Invasion starts the series off with a bang - a set of coordinated attacks by Nazi warriors in futuristic battle armor. We meet our cast of heroes in the midst of chaos: Belladonna Blue, a young azure-skinned healer; Victoria Victrix Nagy, a geomancer fighting panic attacks; Handsome Devil, whose luck is metahumanly good; Red Saviour, strident leader of an anachronistic Soviet team; Red Djinni, the shapeshifting criminal; and John Murdock, a fugitive super-soldier. Watching over them all is the Seraphym, descended from the Infinite to protect humanity.\r\n\r\nAs the heroes fend off the blitzkrieg attack, they are left wondering what secrets have erupted from this hidden world, and whether, once unleashed, they can be contained. For there are clues that all is not what it seems...\r\n",

               "description": "What is education?\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a term we use every day to describe the process of putting 25 or 30 young souls into a cinder block room and filling their heads with what-all over the course of the first quarter of their lives.  But is that education? If it\u2019s not, what is it?  And what are its consequences?\r\n\r\nThe word \u201ceducation\u201d comes to us from the Latin educere, which means \u201cto lead out\u201d or \u201cto draw out.\u201d  What we do in schools, when we attempt to add cumulative layers to children\u2019s bank of knowledge, has little to do with this drawing out; one might go so far as to think that it is its antithesis.  Education\u2014true education\u2014is not a process of pouring in from without, but of calling forth what is within.  It\u2019s not a process of memorization or socialization or instillation, it\u2019s a process of nurturing, of allowing, of evoking.  It\u2019s a process of bringing forth the person one is meant to be.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, is a lifelong project.\r\n\r\n\"The Spirit of Education\" attempts to begin anew our conversations about this thing called education.  It suggests that we start not with what students ought to know, but what humans are.  It suggests that learning isn\u2019t something that happens to children in specialized buildings at the hands of experts, but something that is hardwired into the human animal, an essential goad to our personal and collective evolution.\r\n\r\n\"The Spirit of Education\" isn\u2019t just about schools.  Rather, it\u2019s about learning.  Deep learning.  Real learning.  It suggests that our primary job on the planet is learning:  learning the depths of who we are, and learning how to realize (learning how to make real) the best that is within us.\r\n \r\n<i>Jeff White has written a provocative and solidly-argued analysis of the educational system in the United States. His thinking is based on his own experience as an educator, but he seeks to transcend the narrow bounds of much of the current talk of the 'crisis in education.' We should have a wide-ranging discussion of the premises and future of education in America, and Jeff White's should be a voice in that conversation.</i>\r\n--Glenn Perusek, author, Shifting Terrain:  Essays on Politics, History and Society (New York: Peter Lang, 2006).\r\n \r\n<i>Bravo Jeff! Bravo! I truly admire your accomplishment and respect your work, just as I would any fine craftsman, artist, scholar and teacher.  I want you to know that I really value my personal experience reading this book. I doubt that you would have predicted that your book would be used for personal and professional development of a capitalist, CEO type, but it was in my case...[A] good book at my house is when my wife or I say to other, \"Listen to this;\" your book passed that test.</i>\r\n--Myron Marsh, President and CEO, Thomson-Shore Inc.",

               "description": "Autobiographical coming-of- age tale of five working class boys in the historic village of Cooperstown New York. The story centers around a local brothel called the Sugarhouse, operated by Ma Rutledge, the Maple Sugar Madam, and her two saucy, bovine daughters, Bertha and Emma.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe happiest times at the Sugarhouse came when Ma Rutledge was making maple syrup. During these sap-boiling days the sugary breath of the candy kitchen penetrated everywhere. The beds of the girls were saturated with sweetness. A roll in the hay with Emma or Bertha was like rolling in pastry flour.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut there\u2019s trouble in paradise.\r\n\r\nA new girl arrives at the Sugarhouse, Belle Saint Marie, \u201ca dusky Cajun princess with snapping black eyes and a body no man could ever forget once he'd seen it.\u201d A lovers\u2019 triangle develops, with tragic consequences for local hayshaker Paul Greenfield. \r\n\r\n\u201cGuy DeWolfe and Belle Saint Marie were cut from the same cloth. That was obvious to everyone. The two of them were full of cayenne pepper. It was the French blood that surged in their veins. They were perfectly mated, like a pair of ocelots, hot-natured, highly strung, super-sexed and ferocious. Poor Paul Greenfield, who was easily the dullest man in Otsego County, simply didn't stand a chance.\u201d\r\n\r\nTwenty years later. The author returns to Cooperstown, having lost touch with his four childhood friends. What has become of them? And the Sugarhouse? \r\n\r\n\u201cSupposing the whole town had been bulldozed away to make room for a strip mall, what one thing would I want to remain, to remain forever? Immediately I thought of the Sugarhouse. Yes, the Sugarhouse. Smash everything if you must, but don't destroy the Sugarhouse. That was my prayer.\u201d",

Not exactly. The plot is actually under way.\r\n\r\n\"The Tenth Cow\", the third podcast novel by Aram Schefrin, takes the story to its limits, tracing what has already happened - and what could happen - through a brilliant cast of characters in Israel and America. Add polo, Kabbala, the American President and a strange love affair into the mix and you get a rich stew of romance, satire and suspense and a scary look at what might come to be the most important event of our time. \r\n\r\nTo learn about the facts behind this book, go to http://www.tenthcow.blogspot.com and click on the links.\r\n\r\n",

               "description": "Continuing in the grand tradition of Rumi and Kahlil Gibran, explore the light within your own sensuality in the company of Kabir, the incomparable 15th century poet, weaver, mystic and musician of Benares.\r\n\r\n\"Open the window to the west, / In the sky of love, now be lost; / Drink the sweeter honey that steeps / And imbues with heat, the petals / Of the lotus of the heart's lips. / Receive the waves in your body: / What splendor is in the warm sea! / Hearken to the sounds of conches / And bells, rising through the branches.\"\r\n\r\nThe poetry of this 15th century mystic has been recreated in modern English rhymed couplets by Jabez L. Van Cleef, joining the ranks of his poetic interpretations of spiritual texts from all of the world's great religious traditions.\r\n\r\nVan Cleef's voice in dramatic readings explores the fine distinctions between metered prose and music, by creating a spoken word sound environment that lulls the listener into a state of profound receptivity.\r\n\r\nIn this collection of songs there will be found examples which illustrate nearly every aspect of Kabir's thought, and all the fluctuations of the mystic's emotion: the ecstasy, the despair, the still beatitude, the eager self-devotion, the flashes of wide illumination, the moments of intimate love. All opposites are reconciled: bondage and liberty, love and renunciation, pleasure and pain. Unity is the one thing that matters to the soul, its destiny and its need; and this union, this discovery of God, is the simplest and most natural of all things, if we would but grasp it. It is brought about by love, not by knowledge or ceremonial observances; and the apprehension which that union confers is ineffable--\"neither This nor That,\" as the poet has it. The Divine may best be found in the here-and-now: in the normal, human, bodily existence, the \"mud\" of material life. \"We can reach the goal without crossing the road -- In the home is reality.\" There love and detachment, bondage and freedom, joy and pain play by turns upon the soul; and it is from their conflict that the Unstruck Music of the Infinite proceeds.",

But when you listen, you'll be charmed by how imaginative it is, and in a way that's different from the film.\r\n\r\nI dearly love the movie, but, in this reading, I've tried to approach the story as if I'd never seen it.  My Dorothy is a little younger than her cinematic counterpart and her trio of beloved friends - The Scarecrow, The Tin Woodsman and The Cowardly Lion - are all just a little sillier.  It's hard to escape from the shadow of the MGM spectacular, but I've done my best.\r\nI hope you have as much fun listening as I'm having recording!\r\n\r\nSo sit back, put on your slippers (ruby, silver or whatever color you like) and watch out for flying monkeys!  Load up your MP3 player and remember - There's no place like home!\r\n",

Experimenting from putting short-short fiction to novellas over their podcasts, these writers were the first to test the new medium for storytelling. Some wrote specifically for podcasts, some read previously published fiction, and some read entirely new stories. Some listeners asked if they could get just the stories in audio form, and that request brought about this podiobook. Cory Doctorow tells us a story about a post-apocalyptic government run by sysadmins and James Patrick Kelly narrates a story of a strange reconciliation. We've collected 18 stories for you, the first short fiction to go out over podcast, and look forward to bringing you more. ",

We venture out into a world where the rules are different then the rules we grew up with. We find that the rules are different than the ones we were taught in school. We get into our cars. We hail taxi cabs. We walk in the rain. We take trains and buses. We navigate security lines at crowded airports. In short, we make the necessary sacrifices to insure that we can not only survive but thrive in this life. We do what needs to be done because we want more out of this life.\r\n\r\nDuring this quest have you ever felt like you needed to step back and get a clear view of the situation?

The world of White Trash Land.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter inheriting a trailer park, Chuck\u2019s normally staid life is suddenly filled with an ex-wrestler lawyer, an obsessed Reverend who covets the land the trailer park sits on, a band of Promised Ones who set out to appropriate the park by any means necessary, a corrupt mayor, an old alcoholic and two pretty lesbians who are not exactly as they seem, and a blue haired punk film student who can create miracle inventions out of trash. Not to mention a motorcycle gang, and the mother of a rap wunderkind.\r\n\r\n\r\nStir in a bit of conspiracy, a bit of slapstick and a whole lot of Japanese Actuaries, and you have White Trash Land, written by Andrew Beatty and performed by Sean McGaughey.  Find out more at whitetrashland.wordpress.com .  This novel contains some adult language, adult situations and cartoon violence, so get over it.",

               "description": "Wrightales are original fairy tales for grownups who have never quite grown up written and read by Lisa Wright. Though they follow the conventions of traditional tales, they have more humor than the Brothers Grimm, fewer princesses than Disney, and a lot less gore than Angela Carter. Wrightales take on eternal conundrums like: how to avoid ending up in the middle of nowhere, discovering the Secret to Happiness, and the search for a life that doesn\u2019t involve goats.\r\n\r\n            They take a whimsical, once-upon-a-time view of life\u2019s quandaries and travails. The search for happiness and fulfillment is explored with humor and imagination. There are wizards and dragons, wild geese and small white dogs, magic and trickery, and all varieties of love. This collection brings together nine fairy tales in 16 chapters. All but one of the stories are complete in one or 2 episodes.\r\n\r\nThe fairy tale tradition is alive and well and not just for kids, though kids are welcome, too.",
