Purpose
-------

The purpose of the Podiobooks project is to create a platform for distributing media via either direct download or via scheduled, updated RSS feeds. Additionally, there should be a strong community element, allowing consumers to connect with each other and the author.  This software will eventually replace the current PHP-based solution at http://www.podiobooks.com.
