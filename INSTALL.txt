Welcome!

Here's how to install the Podiobooks Codebase, so you can develop against it.

The tools here are the recommended set, if you have a preferred tool, feel free to substitute, but this is a know working and supported set.

This build is specifically for Windows developers, but the basics are cross-platform, and you should be able to get it to work in Linux or Mac OS X as well.

Typically, you don't need to install all the python bits except on windows, but you should double check you have them.

----------INSTALL YOUR TOOLS---------
1)Install Python
    -- The ActiveState Community Edition is recommended.
    -- It's a quick and easy free way to get Python up and going on Windows.
    -- http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads.
    -- The ActiveState version comes with pypm, which enables devscripts/virtualenv/setup_dev_env.bat to install for you.
    -- The 32-bit version is required to use the setup scripts, as the 64-bit version requires a subscription.
    -- In order to avoid strange path errors, you should reboot after installing ActiveState Python.

2) Download PyCharm from http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
    -- PyCharm is not free, but seems to be smoother overall than Aptana/PyDev.
    -- PyCharm does have a free 30-day trial, student, and open-source licenses.
    -- We have an open-source license for PyCharm for this project - email the lead if you need it.
    -- Use whatever IDE or text editor you want, but the rest of the instructions assume PyCharm.

3) Download GitHub for Windows from http://windows.github.com/
    -- There is a mac version here: http://mac.github.com/
		
For all of those items, you should be able to basically follow the Installer prompts and get them installed with the default settings.

----------CLONE THE CODE-------
1) Go to GitHub.com and setup an account
2) If you want to check in code regularly, email tim@cyface.com to on the contributor list.
3) If you just want to look through the code, go to https://github.com/podiobooks/podiobooks and click the "Watch" button.
4) Open PyCharm.
5) Choose "Check out from Version Control".
6) Select GitHub.
7) You will see a list of projects, choose podiobooks/podiobooks.
8) Wait for the clone to complete, and then choose "Open Directory" when prompted to do so.
9) You have the code!

-----------SETUP PYTHON ENVIRONMENT--------
1) Run the devscripts/virtualenv/setup_dev_env.bat script.
    -- You can setup an "External Tool" in PyCharm to run this, just set the working dir to the podiobooks dir, not the podiobooks/podiobooks dir.
    -- You need to run this from the podiobooks dir (not podiobooks/podiobooks), so if you want to run from the command line, make sure you cd into there first.
    -- This will create a local virtual environment with all the needed Python packages for development.
    -- It will look like it's hung - and depending on your network connection, it can take up to an hour to run.
    -- There is a .sh version for the Mac.

-----------SETUP PYCHARM----------
1) Open PyCharm
2) File->Settings...
3) Python Interpreters
4) Add (button on top of screen)
5) Browse to [YOUR PROJECT PATH]\podiobooks-env\Scripts\python.exe and click "Add".
6) In Settings, under "Project Interpreter", select the new Interpreter you just created.
7) In Settings, under "Django Support", select the project directory to be the podiobooks/podiobooks dir, it should auto-pop settings.py and manage.py.
8) Save the settings

----------SETUP THE DJANGO DB-------
1) From the Tools menu choose "Run manage.py task".
2) Type "syncdb" and click run.
3) Follow the prompts to set up an admin user.
4) From the Tools menu choose "Run manage.py task".
5) Type "migrate" and click run the base South migration to update the 'main' tables.

-----------RUN----------
1) At the top of the PyCharm window, there should now be a dropdown that says "podiobooks" with a green arrow to the right.
2) Click the drop down and select "Edit Configurations".
3) Click on "podiobooks"
4) Check "Run Browser"
5) Set the working directory to the podiobooks\podiobooks directory
8) Save Configuration
7) Select podiobooks from the dropdown and click the green arrow.
